Here's a project I did in my Pattern Theory course in the spring semester of 2023. Note that there are a few typos in the project.

See below for the project PDF.

```{=html}
<style>
.pdf {
  max-width: 100%;
    width: 600px;
    height: 600px;
    border: 10px solid rgba(0,0,0,.2);
    margin: 0;
}
</style>
```

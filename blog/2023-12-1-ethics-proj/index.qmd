### **Introduction**

In this epoch of technological evolution, artificial intelligence stands at the forefront, bringing forth a paradigm shift in various domains, including environmental research. This shift, however, is not without its dichotomies. AI, while being a potent instrument in environmental conservation efforts that can help address the biggest issues in the field, contributes to environmental issues as well, primarily through its significant carbon emissions. In addition to high carbon output, AI systems have a high human cost, as the technology is deeply rooted in the exploitation of human capital.[@dhar] Training AI models has been a revolution in the sense that it has almost broken Moore's Law, which states that computational capacity doubles roughly every 18 months. An analysis of the OpenAI research lab found that its AI training models had been doubling in capacity every 3.4 months from 2012 to 2018.[@dhar] This is roughly a 300,000x increase from Moore's Law over this six year period, a shocking result that speaks to the speed and scale at which AI is being integrated, scaled and refined. However, this incredible increase in the capacity of AI comes with a price that is paid by the environment since the energy outputs from training these models are high. The aviation industry will be used as a parallel case study to demonstrate the potential transformation the field of AI could undergo. This discussion aims to delve deeper into this paradox of the benefits that AI brings to solving environmental problems while also realizing the negative environmental impact of these systems, exploring AI's dual role in environmental research and its broader implications. Understanding and addressing AI's environmental footprint is not just a technological imperative but a moral and ecological one that is only to get more nuanced as AI continues its sweep over modern civilization.

### **Paradox of AI in Environmental Research**

AI's multifaceted nature in environmental research is a blend of promise and peril. It offers groundbreaking capabilities in analyzing and predicting environmental changes, such as climate variations and pollution patterns. However, the carbon footprint associated with training sophisticated AI models is substantial, thereby contributing to the very environmental challenges it seeks to mitigate.

First, consider the promise. There are many incredible AI systems being built that aid in the advancement of carbon neutrality. The International Methane Emissions Observatory leverages AI to revolutionize approaches of monitoring and mitigating methane emissions. The platform is an open source, public database that connects methane emissions data with action on science, transparency and policy to inform the best possible data driven decision.[@unep] CO2 AI is another powerful industry player that helps corporations measure, track, simulate and optimize their emissions at scale. The company's AI tools implement deep learning techniques and graph theory to increase the accuracy of emission measurements. A third example of a company using AI to address the climate crisis is Earth Insights, a collaborative effort between Hewlett Packard and Conservation International, that uses AI to monitor biodiversity loss of tropical forests worldwide with the goal of protecting these ecosystems through science and policy initiatives. These are only three of the many companies and initiatives that are utilizing AI to reduce the effects of the impending climate crisis through a wide array of strategies. Improvements in energy grid efficiency, vehicle carbon output, building and city emissions, industry-related efficiency improvements in design, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, and farming are some other examples of the benefits AI brings to the table.

In the swiftly evolving landscape of AI development, a proliferating concern has emerged regarding the environmental impact of these sophisticated systems. The University of Massachusetts Amherst conducted a pivotal study, focusing on the energy consumption and consequent carbon emissions of training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Their findings are stark, revealing that the carbon footprint of training a single, large language model approximates an astonishing 300,000 kg of CO2 emissions. To put this into a more tangible perspective, consider someone driving a car or flying in an airplane. The average car, for instance, emits about 4.6 metric tons (or 4,600 kg) of carbon dioxide annually. In this context, the emissions from training one of these language models equate to the yearly emissions of nearly 65 cars. Similarly, if we consider air travel, a single flight from New York to San Francisco generates about 1 ton of CO2 per passenger. Thus, the emissions from training a large language model are roughly equivalent to 300 such flights. These comparisons shed light on the environmental footprint of AI development, underscoring the need for more sustainable practices in this rapidly advancing field. The energy required for these systems will increase as these AI systems get more powerful and robust, so this problem will only become more pressing over time unless there is a significant shift in where AI systems get their energy from.[@CarbonEmissions]

AI's carbon footprint undeniably casts a long shadow over environmental ecosystems, influencing them at both granular and broader scales. This paradoxical situation, where AI's immediate benefits in environmental research are contrasted against the more protracted environmental impacts of its carbon emissions, forms a complex ethical tableau. An example of this dichotomy is that data centers, pivotal to AI operations, are now outpacing the aviation industry in greenhouse gas emissions. 

Venturing into renewable energy solutions for AI systems uncovers additional ecological concerns. Consider lithium, a critical component in the creation of rechargeable batteries. The extraction of this element is a water-intensive process; every ton of lithium extraction requires about 500,000 gallons of water. This immense water consumption has profound environmental repercussions. In Chile, the world's second-largest lithium producer, the indigenous Copiapó communities find themselves in a contentious struggle with mining companies over vital land and water rights. These mining activities in regions like Salar de Atacama are so water-intensive that, according to the Institute for Energy Research, they account for 65% of the area's water usage. The resultant water loss inflicts severe damage on the local ecosystems, leading to the depletion of wetlands and water sources. Such environmental degradation has far-reaching effects, endangering native flora and fauna and severely impacting the lives and livelihoods of local populations. This situation presents a nuanced challenge: while strides in AI technology are heralded for their potential to address environmental issues, their underlying infrastructure and energy sources inadvertently contribute to ecological degradation. The pursuit of technological advancement in AI, therefore, necessitates a careful consideration of its environmental trade-offs, urging a thoughtful and sustainable approach to innovation. The ethical implications of using high-carbon-footprint AI in environmental research revolve around a fundamental conflict. This conflict lies in balancing the immediate utility of AI in research endeavors against the long-term environmental costs, raising questions about the ethical responsibilities of researchers and developers.

# Introduction

Have you ever stopped to think about how the food on your plate got there? Sure, you probably bought it at the grocery store or ordered it at a restaurant, but what influenced the availability and price of that food? The answer may surprise you: government agricultural subsidies play a significant role in shaping our food system. In this blog post, we'll take an in-depth look at how these subsidies are allocated in the United States and compare them to policies in other countries. We'll also explore the consequences of these subsidies on our health and the environment.

# The Problem with Rent-Seeking and Collective Action

At the heart of the issue lies the profit-driven nature of agricultural production in the United States. Large corporations often capture a disproportionate share of government subsidies, engaging in a practice known as "rent-seeking." This means that instead of focusing on producing nutritious, high-quality food, these companies are more interested in competing for subsidies. The result? A food system that prioritizes quantity over quality, with serious implications for our health. But why don't consumers just demand better options? The answer lies in the collective action dilemma and cheaper costs of food that is less nutrient dense. With the sheer volume of food consumed in the US each year, one person's dietary choices have little impact on overall demand. This can make efforts to consume thoughtfully grown, nutritious products feel pointless. Furthermore, limited access to information about proper nutrition and the influence of lobbying efforts by large agricultural corporations make it even harder for individuals to make informed decisions. Furthermore, fast food companies and a lack of quality produce available incentivize an inefficient diet. 

# The Corn and Cattle Conundrum

Now, let's dive deeper into one of the most striking examples of problematic agricultural subsidies: corn. Corn subsidies have been a mainstay of US agricultural policy for decades, accounting for 27% of all agricultural subsidies since 1995 [@Hughes]. These subsidies have led to a massive overproduction of corn, with far-reaching consequences on our health and the environment. One of the most significant impacts of corn subsidies has been the proliferation of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). This cheap, highly-processed sweetener has become ubiquitous in the American food supply, thanks in large part to the artificially low price of corn. However, numerous studies have linked the consumption of HFCS to a host of chronic health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease [@NIH]. By subsidizing the production of corn, the government is essentially subsidizing the production of an ingredient that is making us sick.

But the negative impacts of corn subsidies don't stop there. Roughly one-third of all subsidized corn is used for livestock feed, particularly in the beef industry [@JAMA]. This has led to the rise of massive, industrialized cattle feedlots, where animals are crammed together and fattened up on a diet of cheap, subsidized corn. These feedlots are environmental disasters, producing staggering amounts of greenhouse gases, water pollution, and land degradation. The combination of corn subsidies and industrialized cattle production creates a vicious cycle of environmental destruction and health consequences. The cheap, abundant corn produced due to subsidies enables the growth of environmentally harmful feedlots, while the concentration of animals in these feedlots leads to increased pollution and disease risk [@Kolok]. Meanwhile, the overconsumption of corn-based products like HFCS contributes to a range of chronic health problems that burden our healthcare system and diminish quality of life. 

Despite the clear and well-documented harm caused by corn subsidies and industrialized cattle production, these practices continue to receive significant government support. This is a clear failure of agricultural policy, one that prioritizes the interests of large agribusinesses over the health of our citizens and the environment. It's time for a fundamental shift in how we approach agricultural subsidies, one that recognizes the true costs of our current system and seeks to promote more sustainable, health-promoting practices.

# Looking Overseas for Solutions

While the situation in the United States may seem bleak, other countries offer valuable examples of alternative approaches to agricultural subsidies. 

Let's start with Australia, where pasture cropping practices are gaining traction [@FarmWeekly]. This method involves growing an annual crop alongside perennial pasture grasses, allowing for the production of both food and livestock while maintaining soil health and preventing erosion. By promoting sustainable practices, the Australian government is actively working to mitigate the environmental damage caused by traditional livestock farming. 

New Zealand takes things a step further by completely eliminating agricultural subsidies [@Politico]. This bold move has forced farmers to adopt more efficient practices and has led to improved environmental outcomes, such as better water quality and reduced overgrazing. New Zealand's success story proves that it is possible to have a thriving agricultural sector without relying on government handouts. 

Finally, let's look at Finland, where the government has taken a proactive approach to improve the health of its citizens through targeted subsidies. By subsidizing specialty crops and reducing subsidies for commodity crops, Finland has seen a decrease in cardiovascular mortality rates and improvements in average blood pressure and cholesterol levels [@Pietinen]. This case study demonstrates the potential for government policies to directly influence public health outcomes.

# The Path Forward

So, what can we learn from these international examples, and how can we apply them to the United States? 

First and foremost, we need to recognize that the current system of agricultural subsidies is broken. It prioritizes the interests of large corporations over the health of our citizens and the environment. By redirecting subsidies away from commodity crops and towards specialty crops and regenerative farming practices, we could make nutritious foods more affordable and accessible while also promoting environmental sustainability. However, this shift will require more than just policy changes. We need a concerted effort to educate the public about the importance of proper nutrition and the impact of our food choices on the environment. This could involve expanding nutrition education programs in schools, launching public awareness campaigns, and increasing transparency about the environmental and health costs of our current food system. Additionally, we must hold our elected officials accountable for the policies they support. This means demanding an end to subsidies that prioritize corporate interests over public health and environmental sustainability. It also means supporting candidates who are committed to reforming our agricultural system and backing regenerative practices.

# Conclusion

The failure of agricultural subsidies in the United States is a complex and multifaceted issue, but it is not an impossible situation to solve. By learning from the successes and failures of other countries, and by committing to prioritizing health and sustainability over corporate profits, we can create a food system that works for everyone. But this change won't happen overnight, and it won't happen without the active participation of informed and engaged citizens. So, the next time you sit down to a meal, take a moment to think about the journey that food took to reach your plate. And then ask yourself: what can I do to ensure that journey becomes a healthier, more sustainable one? Together, we have the power to transform our food system and create a better future for ourselves and the planet.

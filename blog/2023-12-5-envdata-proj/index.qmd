I need to create a virtual environment to run this blog post in

import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization

import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in AQI data for the years 2017 and 2018 from online sources

# Check data types for each dataset

dtypes_17 = aqi_17.dtypes dtypes_18 = aqi_18.dtypes print("Data types for 2017 dataset:\n", dtypes_17)

# Get basic information about the datasets

info_17 = aqi_17.info() info_18 = aqi_18.info()

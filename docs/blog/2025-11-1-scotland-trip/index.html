<p><em>When we destroy ecosystems, we’re not just losing what we know is there, we’re losing everything we haven’t yet had the chance to discover.</em></p>

<h1>Being With the Mountain</h1>
<p>“Yet often the mountain gives itself most completely when I have no destination, when I reach nowhere in particular, but have gone out merely to be with the mountain as one visits a friend with no intention but to be with him.”</p>
<p><strong>― Nan Shepherd, The Living Mountain</strong></p>
<p>Before my first site visit to the Scottish Highlands, I read Nan Shepherd’s <em>The Living Mountain</em> for my family book club. Shepherd, a Scottish poet and novelist who spent most of her life walking the Cairngorms, wrote with an intimacy about the landscape that was both philosophical and deeply grounded in lived experience. Her approach was rooted in her presence, about developing a sort of personal relationship with the landscape.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-work-behind-the-wandering" class="level1">
<h1>The Work Behind the Wandering</h1>
<p>At Zulu Ecosystems, we’re an end-to-end nature restoration project developer working across the UK. From peatland and woodland restoration to thinking about biodiversity and water management, we work with estate owners, water companies, farming groups, universities, and more to help heal the damanged British landscapes. I have been developing analytics and tools to help us deliver more projects, with our office is in a Notting Hill, building data pipelines and learning what science looks like in a business environment.</p>
<p>My particular recent focus has been on modeling erosion features—areas of exposed bare peat that are essentially wounds in the landscape. These aren’t just aesthetic concerns. Globally, degraded peat emits around 2 billion tons of greenhouse gases annually. Think about that scale for a moment. And that’s not even accounting for the countless species that depend on healthy peatland habitats.</p>
<p>The classic challenge with remote sensing and modeling is how to distinguish signal from noise. In our case, that means refining algorithms to reduce false positives, which in this case are places the model identified as erosion features that were actually patches of heather or natural water pooling areas. It’s one thing to see these polygons on a screen in London; it’s entirely another to see, feel, and walk around them in the field.</p>
</section>
<section id="two-feet-on-the-ground" class="level1">
<h1>Two Feet on the Ground</h1>
<p>The surveying was methodical and absorbing. We conducted peat depth and condition assessments, detailed habitat surveys, herbivore impact studies, and biodiversity inventories. Most of our work involved species identification and assessing herbivore presence within assigned 4-by-1-meter grid areas. It is the kind of systematic fieldwork that requires complete attention. You become locked into the landscape in a way that’s both focused and meditative.</p>
<p>There’s something powerful about getting two feet on the ground in places you’ve only known through QGIS on a laptop screen. The abstractions of spatial data suddenly have texture, smell, the sound of wind across water. Places become places, not just pixels.</p>
<p>During these surveys, I felt peaceful and present in a way that reminded me of Shepherd’s writing. Here was that quality of “being with” rather than simply observing or measuring. Yet there was also a deeper current of reflection, with questions about how we got here, where we fit into these systems, what our role should be.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-best-lunch" class="level1">
<h1>The Best Lunch</h1>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/scotland_view.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">View from the knoll overlooking the Scottish landscape</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Lunch time is one of my favorite times. On Wednesday, I climbed up to a knoll overlooking the landscape, excited to see the view from higher ground. What I found there was stunning. Sitting with my lunch, looking down a steep slope down to the loch, I felt the cold wind coming off the water, a reminder of the raw intensity of these elements, the power of this place.</p>
<p>This was where Shepherd’s philosophy really set in for me. I wasn’t there to conquer anything or reach some destination. I was just there to be present with the mountain. The landscape opened up not just visually but conceptually. I found myself reading the terrain differently and thinking about how it had transformed over time, sometimes for the better, increasingly for the worse because of human activities and interventions.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-weight-of-our-influence" class="level1">
<h1>The Weight of Our Influence</h1>
<p>We are, as a species, so innovative, creative, complicated, and selfish. Our influence on the world, especially over the last few centuries, is incredibly tangle. While we’re just a speck on the timeline of this planet, we’re an undeniably large speck. The evidence surrounds you in these Scottish landscapes, in the transition zones from heather to bog, in the grazing pressures, in the very erosion features I’ve been modeling.</p>
<p>The sphagnum moss that carpets healthy sections of the peatland tells a different story. Its colors pop against the darker peats, vibrant greens and reds that seem almost otherworldly, like a coral reef on land. But it’s the temporal scale that hits me most. This moss, decomposing slowly into peat over centuries and even millennia, is one of our planet’s most effective carbon storage systems. A single hectare can store up to 60 tonnes of carbon, acting as a massive sink slowly giving itself back into the soil.</p>
<p>The timescale of these habitats is massive. The repetition of these plants returning into the landscape, building carbon storage layer by layer, century after century. And how quickly we can undo that work when we put our fingerprint on these systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="models-versus-reality" class="level1">
<h1>Models versus Reality</h1>
<p>On our final day, I had the chance to do something closer to Shepherd’s wandering. While collecting data on the erosion features I’d been modeling, I could really see how the algorithms were performing in the real world. The most valuable insights came from understanding the false positives, or more specifically learning to distinguish the spectral signatures of actual bare peat from heather or standing water that might look similar to a sensor.</p>
<p>This ground-truthing made me think about both the power and limitations of remote sensing. Models are incredibly useful tools, but they’re just that—tools. They help us understand patterns, try to identify the extent to which we are restoring the habitat. But they can’t replace the knowledge that comes from being present in the landscape, from developing the kind of familiarity that Shepherd wrote about.</p>
</section>
<section id="different-priorities" class="level1">
<h1>Different Priorities</h1>
<p>One of the most illuminating aspects of the site visit was learning how peatland restoration fits into the broader ecosystem of activities on the estate. Things are dynamic and interconnected. There are multiple priorities, things like hunting, deer culling, woodland management, that all influence and are influenced by each other. My experience showed me the value in understanding how human activities, wildlife management, hydrology, and vegetation dynamics all interact.</p>
<p>This complexity is a good reminder for how ecosystem restoration is both an art and a science. The technical knowledge, understanding carbon cycles, hydrology, species relationships, is important. But so is the ability to see the whole system, to understand how different priorities and stakeholders can work together rather than against each other.</p>
</section>
<section id="london" class="level1">
<h1>London</h1>
<p>As I write this back in London, I think about how the field experience has changed my relationship to the work. The images I see on my screen now represent specific places, that knoll where I had lunch, the area where I saw the most vibrant sphagnum, the spots where deer presence told stories.</p>
<p>But there’s something else Shepherd understood that feels more urgent now: when we damage these landscapes, we’re not just losing what we know is there. We’re losing everything we haven’t yet had the chance to discover. The intricate relationships between species we haven’t identified, the climate services we haven’t quantified, the carbon storage potential we haven’t realized.</p>
<p>In our work at Zulu Ecosystems, we’re trying to reverse some of that loss. Project by project, we’re helping landscapes heal. IIn the grand scheme of things, i’s slow work, ultimately linked to the timescale of flora and fauna like the patient building of peat by sphagnum moss. But at the same time its incredibly urgent work, given the scale of the challenges we face.</p>
<p>Sitting on that knoll, feeling the wind off the loch, I felt lucky to be doing this work. Grateful, excited, and inspired be part of efforts that bring together technology and ecological wisdom, that connect the precision of remote sensing with the irreplaceable knowledge that comes from being present in the landscape.</p>
<p>We are just one species in this whole thing. But we’re also the species with the greatest power, either to heal or harm. In these Scottish Highliands, surrounded by a rich mosaic of creatures, processes, and existence, that responsibility feels real.</p>
<p>The mountain, as Shepherd knew, gives itself most completely when we approach it not as conquerors but as friends. The same might be true of our relationship with all the landscapes we’re working to restore.</p>

<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-23"><a href="#cb1-23" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Before my first site visit to the Scottish Highlands, I read Nan Shepherd's *The Living Mountain* for my family book club. Shepherd, a Scottish poet and novelist who spent most of her life walking the Cairngorms, wrote with an intimacy about the landscape that was both philosophical and deeply grounded in lived experience. Her approach was rooted in her presence, about developing a sort of personal relationship with the landscape.</span>

<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>At Zulu Ecosystems, we're an end-to-end nature restoration project developer working across the UK. From peatland and woodland restoration to thinking about biodiversity and water management, we work with estate owners, water companies, farming groups, universities, and more to help heal the damanged British landscapes. I have been developing analytics and tools to help us deliver more projects, with our office is in a Notting Hill, building data pipelines and learning what science looks like in a business environment.</span>
<span id="cb1-28"><a href="#cb1-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-29"><a href="#cb1-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>My particular recent focus has been on modeling erosion features—areas of exposed bare peat that are essentially wounds in the landscape. These aren't just aesthetic concerns. Globally, degraded peat emits around 2 billion tons of greenhouse gases annually. Think about that scale for a moment. And that's not even accounting for the countless species that depend on healthy peatland habitats.</span>
<span id="cb1-30"><a href="#cb1-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-31"><a href="#cb1-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The classic challenge with remote sensing and modeling is how to distinguish signal from noise. In our case, that means refining algorithms to reduce false positives, which in this case are places the model identified as erosion features that were actually patches of heather or natural water pooling areas. It's one thing to see these polygons on a screen in London; it's entirely another to see, feel, and walk around them in the field.</span>

<span id="cb1-34"><a href="#cb1-34" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-35"><a href="#cb1-35" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The surveying was methodical and absorbing. We conducted peat depth and condition assessments, detailed habitat surveys, herbivore impact studies, and biodiversity inventories. Most of our work involved species identification and assessing herbivore presence within assigned 4-by-1-meter grid areas. It is the kind of systematic fieldwork that requires complete attention. You become locked into the landscape in a way that's both focused and meditative.</span>
<span id="cb1-36"><a href="#cb1-36" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-37"><a href="#cb1-37" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>There's something powerful about getting two feet on the ground in places you've only known through QGIS on a laptop screen. The abstractions of spatial data suddenly have texture, smell, the sound of wind across water. Places become places, not just pixels.</span>
<span id="cb1-38"><a href="#cb1-38" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-39"><a href="#cb1-39" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>During these surveys, I felt peaceful and present in a way that reminded me of Shepherd's writing. Here was that quality of "being with" rather than simply observing or measuring. Yet there was also a deeper current of reflection, with questions about how we got here, where we fit into these systems, what our role should be.</span>

<span id="cb1-44"><a href="#cb1-44" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-45"><a href="#cb1-45" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Lunch time is one of my favorite times. On Wednesday, I climbed up to a knoll overlooking the landscape, excited to see the view from higher ground. What I found there was stunning. Sitting with my lunch, looking down a steep slope down to the loch, I felt the cold wind coming off the water, a reminder of the raw intensity of these elements, the power of this place.</span>
<span id="cb1-46"><a href="#cb1-46" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-47"><a href="#cb1-47" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This was where Shepherd's philosophy really set in for me. I wasn't there to conquer anything or reach some destination. I was just there to be present with the mountain. The landscape opened up not just visually but conceptually. I found myself reading the terrain differently and thinking about how it had transformed over time, sometimes for the better, increasingly for the worse because of human activities and interventions.</span>

<span id="cb1-49"><a href="#cb1-49" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># The Weight of Our Influence</span></span>
<span id="cb1-50"><a href="#cb1-50" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-51"><a href="#cb1-51" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We are, as a species, so innovative, creative, complicated, and selfish. Our influence on the world, especially over the last few centuries, is incredibly tangle. While we're just a speck on the timeline of this planet, we're an undeniably large speck. The evidence surrounds you in these Scottish landscapes, in the transition zones from heather to bog, in the grazing pressures, in the very erosion features I've been modeling.</span>
<span id="cb1-52"><a href="#cb1-52" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-53"><a href="#cb1-53" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The sphagnum moss that carpets healthy sections of the peatland tells a different story. Its colors pop against the darker peats, vibrant greens and reds that seem almost otherworldly, like a coral reef on land. But it's the temporal scale that hits me most. This moss, decomposing slowly into peat over centuries and even millennia, is one of our planet's most effective carbon storage systems. A single hectare can store up to 60 tonnes of carbon, acting as a massive sink slowly giving itself back into the soil.</span>
<span id="cb1-54"><a href="#cb1-54" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-55"><a href="#cb1-55" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The timescale of these habitats is massive. The repetition of these plants returning into the landscape, building carbon storage layer by layer, century after century. And how quickly we can undo that work when we put our fingerprint on these systems.</span>

<span id="cb1-57"><a href="#cb1-57" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># Models versus Reality</span></span>
<span id="cb1-58"><a href="#cb1-58" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-59"><a href="#cb1-59" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>On our final day, I had the chance to do something closer to Shepherd's wandering. While collecting data on the erosion features I'd been modeling, I could really see how the algorithms were performing in the real world. The most valuable insights came from understanding the false positives, or more specifically learning to distinguish the spectral signatures of actual bare peat from heather or standing water that might look similar to a sensor.</span>
<span id="cb1-60"><a href="#cb1-60" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-61"><a href="#cb1-61" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This ground-truthing made me think about both the power and limitations of remote sensing. Models are incredibly useful tools, but they're just that—tools. They help us understand patterns, try to identify the extent to which we are restoring the habitat. But they can't replace the knowledge that comes from being present in the landscape, from developing the kind of familiarity that Shepherd wrote about.</span>

<span id="cb1-63"><a href="#cb1-63" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu"># Different Priorities</span></span>
<span id="cb1-64"><a href="#cb1-64" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-65"><a href="#cb1-65" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>One of the most illuminating aspects of the site visit was learning how peatland restoration fits into the broader ecosystem of activities on the estate. Things are dynamic and interconnected. There are multiple priorities, things like hunting, deer culling, woodland management, that all influence and are influenced by each other. My experience showed me the value in understanding how human activities, wildlife management, hydrology, and vegetation dynamics all interact.</span>
<span id="cb1-66"><a href="#cb1-66" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-67"><a href="#cb1-67" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This complexity is a good reminder for how ecosystem restoration is both an art and a science. The technical knowledge, understanding carbon cycles, hydrology, species relationships, is important. But so is the ability to see the whole system, to understand how different priorities and stakeholders can work together rather than against each other.</span>
<span id="cb1-68"><a href="#cb1-68" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>

<span id="cb1-71"><a href="#cb1-71" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>As I write this back in London, I think about how the field experience has changed my relationship to the work. The images I see on my screen now represent specific places, that knoll where I had lunch, the area where I saw the most vibrant sphagnum, the spots where deer presence told stories.</span>
<span id="cb1-72"><a href="#cb1-72" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-73"><a href="#cb1-73" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>But there's something else Shepherd understood that feels more urgent now: when we damage these landscapes, we're not just losing what we know is there. We're losing everything we haven't yet had the chance to discover. The intricate relationships between species we haven't identified, the climate services we haven't quantified, the carbon storage potential we haven't realized.</span>
<span id="cb1-74"><a href="#cb1-74" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-75"><a href="#cb1-75" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In our work at Zulu Ecosystems, we're trying to reverse some of that loss. Project by project, we're helping landscapes heal. IIn the grand scheme of things, i's slow work, ultimately linked to the timescale of flora and fauna like the patient building of peat by sphagnum moss. But at the same time its incredibly urgent work, given the scale of the challenges we face.</span>
<span id="cb1-76"><a href="#cb1-76" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-77"><a href="#cb1-77" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Sitting on that knoll, feeling the wind off the loch, I felt lucky to be doing this work. Grateful, excited, and inspired be part of efforts that bring together technology and ecological wisdom, that connect the precision of remote sensing with the irreplaceable knowledge that comes from being present in the landscape.</span>
<span id="cb1-78"><a href="#cb1-78" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-79"><a href="#cb1-79" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We are just one species in this whole thing. But we're also the species with the greatest power, either to heal or harm. In these Scottish Highliands, surrounded by a rich mosaic of creatures, processes, and existence, that responsibility feels real.</span>
<span id="cb1-80"><a href="#cb1-80" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-81"><a href="#cb1-81" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The mountain, as Shepherd knew, gives itself most completely when we approach it not as conquerors but as friends. The same might be true of our relationship with all the landscapes we're working to restore.</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

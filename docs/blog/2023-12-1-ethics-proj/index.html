<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>In this epoch of technological evolution, artificial intelligence stands at the forefront, bringing forth a paradigm shift in various domains, including environmental research. This shift, however, is not without its dichotomies. AI, while being a potent instrument in environmental conservation efforts that can help address the biggest issues in the field, contributes to environmental issues as well, primarily through its significant carbon emissions. In addition to high carbon output, AI systems have a high human cost, as the technology is deeply rooted in the exploitation of human capital. Training AI models has been a revolution in the sense that it has almost broken Moore’s Law, which states that computational capacity doubles roughly every 18 months. An analysis of the OpenAI research lab found that its AI training models had been doubling in capacity every 3.4 months from 2012 to 2018.[<span class="citation" data-cites="openai">OpenAI (<a href="#ref-openai" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>] This is roughly a 300,000x increase from Moore’s Law over this six year period, a shocking result that speaks to the speed and scale at which AI is being integrated, scaled and refined. However, this incredible increase in the capacity of AI comes with a price that is paid by the environment since the energy outputs from training these models are high. The aviation industry will be used as a parallel case study to demonstrate the potential transformation the field of AI could undergo. This discussion aims to delve deeper into this paradox of the benefits that AI brings to solving environmental problems while also realizing the negative environmental impact of these systems, exploring AI’s dual role in environmental research and its broader implications. Understanding and addressing AI’s environmental footprint is not just a technological imperative but a moral and ecological one that is only to get more nuanced as AI continues its sweep over modern civilization.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paradox-of-ai-in-environmental-research"><strong>Paradox of AI in Environmental Research</strong></h3>
<p>AI’s multifaceted nature in environmental research is a blend of promise and peril. It offers groundbreaking capabilities in analyzing and predicting environmental changes, such as climate variations and pollution patterns. However, the carbon footprint associated with training sophisticated AI models is substantial, thereby contributing to the very environmental challenges it seeks to mitigate.</p>
<p>First, consider the promise. There are many incredible AI systems being built that aid in the advancement of carbon neutrality. The International Methane Emissions Observatory leverages AI to revolutionize approaches of monitoring and mitigating methane emissions. The platform is an open source, public database that connects methane emissions data with action on science, transparency and policy to inform the best possible data driven decision.<span class="citation" data-cites="unep">(<a href="#ref-unep" role="doc-biblioref">UNEP 2022</a>)</span> CO2 AI is another powerful industry player that helps corporations measure, track, simulate and optimize their emissions at scale. The company’s AI tools implement deep learning techniques and graph theory to increase the accuracy of emission measurements. <span class="citation" data-cites="co2ai">(<a href="#ref-co2ai" role="doc-biblioref">AI 2023</a>)</span> A third example of a company using AI to address the climate crisis is Earth Insights, a collaborative effort between Hewlett Packard and Conservation International, that uses AI to monitor biodiversity loss of tropical forests worldwide with the goal of protecting these ecosystems through science and policy initiatives. <span class="citation" data-cites="raedmoussa">(<a href="#ref-raedmoussa" role="doc-biblioref">Moussa 2023</a>)</span> These are only three of the many companies and initiatives that are utilizing AI to reduce the effects of the impending climate crisis through a wide array of strategies. Improvements in energy grid efficiency, vehicle carbon output, building and city emissions, industry-related efficiency improvements in design, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, and farming are some other examples of the benefits AI brings to the table.</p>
<p>In the swiftly evolving landscape of AI development, a proliferating concern has emerged regarding the environmental impact of these sophisticated systems. The University of Massachusetts Amherst conducted a pivotal study, focusing on the energy consumption and consequent carbon emissions of training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Their findings are stark, revealing that the carbon footprint of training a single, large language model approximates an astonishing 300,000 kg of CO2 emissions. <span class="citation" data-cites="umass">(<a href="#ref-umass" role="doc-biblioref">Strubell 2019</a>)</span> To put this into a more tangible perspective, consider someone driving a car or flying in an airplane. The average car, for instance, emits about 4.6 metric tons (or 4,600 kg) of carbon dioxide annually. In this context, the emissions from training one of these language models equate to the yearly emissions of nearly 65 cars. Similarly, if we consider air travel, a single flight from New York to San Francisco generates about 1 ton of CO2 per passenger. Thus, the emissions from training a large language model are roughly equivalent to 300 such flights. These comparisons shed light on the environmental footprint of AI development, underscoring the need for more sustainable practices in this rapidly advancing field. The energy required for these systems will increase as these AI systems get more powerful and robust, so this problem will only become more pressing over time unless there is a significant shift in where AI systems get their energy from. <span class="citation" data-cites="CarbonEmissions">(<a href="#ref-CarbonEmissions" role="doc-biblioref">Visuals 2015</a>)</span></p>

<p>The endeavor to accurately quantify AI’s carbon footprint is riddled with complexities. The muddied nature of energy consumption in data centers, coupled with the diverse methodologies used in AI operations, makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact environmental impact. Crawford and Joler’s insightful analysis sheds light on these hidden costs, revealing the extensive energy consumption behind AI’s operations. <span class="citation" data-cites="sharelab">(<a href="#ref-sharelab" role="doc-biblioref">Crawford 2018</a>)</span> Their work, published by the SHARE Lab SHARE Foundation and the AI Now Institute NYU, offers a profound insight into the often-overlooked environmental consequences of AI development​​. This intricate web of energy use, stretching from the vast data centers to the minutiae of algorithmic calculations, uncovers a distinct reality. The environmental footprint of AI is not merely a byproduct of its computational processes but a deeply embedded aspect of its very existence. As Crawford and Joler illustrate, every facet of AI, from its design to deployment, is intertwined with significant energy demands. <span class="citation" data-cites="sharelab">(<a href="#ref-sharelab" role="doc-biblioref">Crawford 2018</a>)</span> This revelation calls for a recalibration in our approach to AI, urging a shift towards more sustainable practices that consider the long-term ecological impacts. To make matters worse, there is a lack of incentives for companies to share data and publicly display their emissions output. The incredible pace that AI and the overarching computation industry has evolved and globalized over time has led to a few players holding the majority of the control of this infrastructure and policy adaptation.</p>
</section>
<section id="tools-and-methods" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tools-and-methods"><em>Tools and Methods</em></h4>
<p>In the face of these challenges, the field has witnessed the advent of innovative tools aimed at more accurately measuring the energy consumption and emissions of AI processes. A noteworthy contribution is the emissions calculator developed by Alexandre Lacoste and his team. This tool represents a significant stride in our ability to pragmatically estimate the carbon footprint associated with AI operations. The underlying research in creating this calculator underscores that emissions are intricately linked to several factors: the geographical location of the training server, the characteristics of the energy grid powering it, the duration of the training process, and the specific hardware utilized for the training. <span class="citation" data-cites="cornell">(<a href="#ref-cornell" role="doc-biblioref">Lacoste, n.d.</a>)</span> This issue transcends mere technological hurdles, veering into the realms of political will and consumer awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a pressing need for increased transparency in the AI sector. Contrary to a lack of knowledge, companies are quite cognizant of the extent of training conducted on their hardware. They possess detailed insights into the computational demands of various algorithms, akin to the aviation industry’s awareness of the energy efficiency of airplanes.

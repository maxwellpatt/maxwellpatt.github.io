    "text": "In this blog post, I will be diving into some fantasy basketball data visualizations! One of our classes this quarter, Data Visualization and Communication (EDS240), has opened my eyes to how critical data communication is through visual means, how the small changes that an observer might not bat a second glance at can change the entire gist of a visual, and how narrative is imperative in creating a visual for a specific (or general) audience. Building beautiful, crisp visualizations takes time and attention to details, and the class has been a fun deep dive on the different layers that go into building these kind of visuals.\nA.L. Linall Jr frames the power of visualization well: “Visualization and belief in a pattern of reality activates the creative power of realization.” Interpreting raw data is not fun for anyone, but staring at a beautiful scatter plot, stacked area plot, ridge line plot, or heat map can make the process of digesting data more enjoyable. Further, a detailed and aesthetically pleasing visual can guide the observer towards a key takeaway that the creator intended. It is almost impossible to remove all biases and keep all of the important information from a dataset when creating a visual. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind what story the visualization is feeding you into as a consumer.\nFor this final assignment, I will be constructing three different visuals that investigate the dynamic of a dynasty format fantasy basketball league that I am in. Each visual will be tailored for a certain audience: one for a general audience without domain expertise, one that would go well in a presentation, and one for domain experts, or people who know a lot about how dynasty leagues work.\n\n\nI have been in this fantasy basketball league for a few years, but we just switched over to a dynasty format this offseason. Dynasty league formats exist for all fantasy sports, and they are leagues where managers keep their entire roster each season. Most fantasy leagues are redraft format, where there is a full draft each year where teams draft entirely new rosters. In the dynasty format, there is simply a rookie draft where managers only select from the rookie player pool to keep building their rosters. In this sense, a dynasty league is more like being a GM of an NBA team, where players are kept year over year and new players are acquired through trades or the rookie draft. Personally, I have loved this format as it completely changes the dynamic of assessing a player’s value. More on this later.\nStarting a dynasty league can be tricky. The most important distinction between redraft versus dynasty leagues is that all league members must be in it for the long haul - having a team bail after a year or two, for whatever reason, can cause issues if the league is not able to find a replacement. Also, some people might not be as excited about the dynasty format because they may not ever have the opportunity to draft certain players, especially top-end young players, because their value is higher in dynasty formats than redraft leagues. While the dynasty format is not for everyone, I am lucky to be in a league where everyone is engaged, active, and excited about the format. As rookie league member Danny put it, “What other league gets reprimanded for talking too much ball at work?”.\nLeading up to the draft, I think there was a balance of teams that wanted to draft young players and compete for a championship in future years and teams that wanted to get players that could help them be competitive this season. This played out accordingly on draft night, with only two or three teams going young player heavy while the rest of the league went with a more diverse selection of young and older players. However, as the season went on, a few teams really pivoted their dynasty strategy (especially my team) to get younger due to how strong the top of the league is this season. The Bikini Bottom Ballers solidified themselves as one of the greatest dynasty rosters ever assembled, ending the season with a 17-1 record and having over 4000 more fantasy points than the second closest team. During the season, the Ballers acquired even more win-now talent to add on to the players and now have a roster full of win-now players: Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, and Kyrie Irving to name a few. The Ballers are the clear favorites to win the championship this season, but it will be interesting to see how long their reign over the league lasts with many of their players being older and beginning to decline. Anyways, I’m getting ahead of myself as these will be investigated in the following visuals.\nFor more context, my roster transitioned from win-now to building for the future over the course of the season. I had some talented older players on my roster in the beginning of the season, like Kevin Durant and Paul George. Once I realized that the Ballers had such a strong roster that would be hard to beat come playoff time, I made a bunch of trades to build around my teams cornerstone, and arguably the most valuable dynasty asset of all time: Victor Wembanyama. While he is just a rookie, Wemby has put up some insane numbers this season and is looking like he will be a top player as early as next season. Wemby is only 20 years old and is already averaging over 50 fantasy points per game, vaulting himself into unprecedented terrain when it comes to rookie fantasy performance in the modern era. In a recent league survey, the Santa Barbara Swell (my team, by the way the team names and logos in the league are pretty epic) was voted as the team that others would most want to swap rosters with. What an honor!"

    "text": "Setting the Scene\nQuestion: What are the dynamics between age and fantasy scoring across teams in the fantasy league? Which teams are going all in now, and which are looking to build rosters with talented younger players?\n\nData\nNow it’s time to do a little exploration to understand the data that is being worked with. The platform we use for the league, Fantrax, allows for easy downloading of data in CSV formats. I’ll start by importing the data, doing some simple cleaning so it will be ready for further wrangling and analysis. This code is hidden for the reader’s convenience so we can get right to the data exploration.\n\nColumns of Interest\nBelow is a list of the column names in the cleaned data set (rostered):\n\n\nCode\ncolnames(rostered)\n\n\n [1] \"player\"       \"team\"         \"position\"     \"rk_ov\"        \"fantasy_team\"\n [6] \"age\"          \"f_pts\"        \"fp_g\"         \"adp\"          \"fgm\"         \n[11] \"fga\"          \"x3ptm\"        \"ftm\"          \"fta\"          \"pts\"         \n[16] \"reb\"          \"ast\"          \"st\"           \"blk\"          \"to\"          \n[21] \"x3d\"          \"x2d\"         \n\n\nMost of the columns in the data are statistical categories, like points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc. The columns that are most important for this analysis are the age (age), fantasy scoring (f_pts and fp_g), and fantasy team (fantasy_team) columns. Throughout the analysis, summary tables utilizing information from these columns will be generated as needed.\n\n\nLimitations\nI was hoping that Fantrax would save the fantasy team that each player was on at a certain point in the season, but unfortunately this is not the case. For example, I traded for Jalen Duren right before the trade deadline on February 9th, but when downloading data from the first week of the season, it says that Duren was on my roster at this time. I was curious to see if I could track how fantasy rosters changed over the course of the season, but this reality makes that nearly impossible to do as I would have to enter data manually. Instead, I will focus on data from February 26th, which is just 2 weeks out of the fantasy playoffs and gives a good sense of where teams are at towards the end of the season in terms of roster construction.\n\n\n\nApproach\nFor the three graphs, I will be creating a scatter plot, a ridge line plot, and a sunburst plot for the domain expert, general audience, and presentation groups respectively. Each of the plots takes a different look at the dynamic between age and fantasy scoring across each of the fantasy teams. The motivation for choosing each specific graphic form will be discussed after each graph is shown in the next section.\nWhile I played around with different basketball related themes, I will be going with a simple background that is a similar color to NBA courts. Two graphs have all of the team logos (scatter and ridge line), and the sunburst plot is extremely colorful with lots going on, so I opted for keeping the background simple and minimizing distractions from the visualizations. I defined custom colors based on teams logos that are used in the sunburst plot to add to the aesthetics of the visual as there are lots of colors going on. Additionally, I chose the Courier font as the go-to for all three visuals, as it is a crisp and easy-going font that has just the right amount of character.\nWhile DEI has been highlighted in our lecture materials and some other assignments in EDS 240, this analysis does not fit into the category of DEI application."

While there is no perfect number of assets to choose (5, 10, 15), there are 10 starting spots for each night of fantasy play, so it seemed like an appropriate choice. The plot reveals that teams whose top assets are older tend to have higher average fantasy points scoring. A scatter plot is a great plot to visualize this relationship as it clearly displays each team’s top assets as individual points, allowing for the direct observation of the relationship between average age and fantasy points per game. By representing each team’s top assets as individual data points, the scatter plot allows for a direct examination of how age and fantasy points per game are related across the league. The x-axis represents the average age of a team’s top 10 assets, providing a clear measure of the overall experience and veteran presence on each roster. The y-axis displays the average fantasy points per game for those top assets, quantifying the offensive output and statistical production of each team’s core players.\nOne of the key strengths of using a scatter plot in this context is its ability to reveal patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the data. The plot clearly shows a clustering of teams in the upper-right quadrant, indicating that teams with older top assets tend to have higher fantasy points per game averages. This visual representation makes it easy to identify the teams that have prioritized veteran talent and are currently enjoying the benefits of experienced, productive players Furthermore, the scatter plot allows for a quick assessment of the spread and distribution of teams along both dimensions. The plot shows a considerable range in both average age and fantasy points per game, highlighting the diversity of roster construction strategies employed by different teams. Some teams have opted for a mix of younger and older players, while others have focused primarily on either end of the age spectrum.\nAnnotations are added to provide more context on the draft capital of specific teams that have an interesting number of first round picks. In the beginning of the season, each team had 3 first round picks: 2025, 2026, and 2027 (or the next 3 years for the case of future seasons). Teams can trade these picks around, which is a big part of what makes fantasy leagues exciting and unique from redraft leagues. The best teams in the league tend to have less draft capital as they traded it away to acquire win-now players. Also of note, the Santa Barbara Swell owning 7 first round picks is likely to set the franchise up well in the long-term. Teams not labeled either have 3 or 4 first round picks over the next 3 years.\n\n\nPlot 2: Ridge line plot\n\n\nCode\n# Installing new packages\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(viridis)\n\n# Calculate the average age for each fantasy team\nteam_avg_age &lt;- rostered %&gt;%\n  group_by(fantasy_team) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageAge = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Merge the average age data with full data\nrostered &lt;- rostered %&gt;%\n  left_join(team_avg_age, by = \"fantasy_team\")\n\n# Order the teams by average fp_g\nteam_order &lt;- rostered %&gt;%\n  group_by(fantasy_team) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AverageFpG = mean(fp_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(AverageFpG)) %&gt;%\n  pull(fantasy_team)\n\n# Make sure data is ordered correctly for plotting\nrostered$fantasy_team &lt;- factor(rostered$fantasy_team, levels = team_order)\n\n# Define team logos for ridge plot \nlogos &lt;- data.frame(team = c(\"Anacortes\", \"Beaverton\", \"Bikini Bottom\",\n                             \"Cream City\", \"Helsinki\", \"Las Vegas\", \"Malibu\",\n                             \"San Diego\", \"Santa Barbara\", \"Scottsdale\", \n                             \"Slytherin\", \"Winterfell\"),\n                    logo = c(\"images/orcas_logo.png\", \"images/bigfoots_logo.png\", \n                             \"images/ballers_logo.png\", \"images/crusaders_logo.png\",\n                             \"images/hounds_logo.png\", \"images/scorpions_logo.png\",\n                             \"images/milkers_logo.png\", \"images/pilots_logo.png\", \n                             \"images/swell_logo.png\", \"images/stotches_logo.png\",\n                             \"images/serpents_logo.png\", \"images/starks_logo.png\"))\n\n# Adding new column for player images \nlogos$player &lt;- NA\nlogos$player_xcoord &lt;- NA \n\n# Adding player image and x-loc paths\nlogos[logos$team == \"Anacortes\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/embiid.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Anacortes\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 71\nlogos[logos$team == \"Winterfell\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/luka.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Winterfell\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 71\nlogos[logos$team == \"Cream City\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/jokic.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Cream City\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 71\nlogos[logos$team == \"Santa Barbara\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/wemby.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Santa Barbara\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 57\nlogos[logos$team == \"Scottsdale\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/hali.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Scottsdale\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 61\nlogos[logos$team == \"Helsinki\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/sga.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Helsinki\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 68\nlogos[logos$team == \"Las Vegas\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/tatum.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Las Vegas\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 55\nlogos[logos$team == \"Slytherin\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/chet.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Slytherin\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 52\nlogos[logos$team == \"Beaverton\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/fox.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Beaverton\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 55\nlogos[logos$team == \"San Diego\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/book.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"San Diego\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 56\nlogos[logos$team == \"Bikini Bottom\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/giannis.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Bikini Bottom\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 68\nlogos[logos$team == \"Malibu\", \"player\"] &lt;- \"images/lebron.png\"\nlogos[logos$team == \"Malibu\", \"player_xcoord\"] &lt;- 58\n\n# Create ridge plot\nridge_plot &lt;- ggplot(rostered, aes(x = fp_g, y = fantasy_team, fill = AverageAge)) + geom_density_ridges(\n    aes(height = ..density..), \n    alpha = 0.5, \n    scale = 2, \n    rel_min_height = 0.05,\n    trim = TRUE,\n    adjust = 0.2\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Average Age\", option = \"A\") +\n  labs(title = \"Fantasy Scoring Distribution by Team\",\n       subtitle = \"Includes a heatshot of each team's best player\",\n       x = \"Fantasy Points per Game\",\n       y = \"\") +\n  theme_ridges(grid = FALSE) +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Courier\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"antiquewhite\"), \n    panel.background = element_blank(), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(20, 0, 0, 0, \"pt\")), # Adds space\n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(0, 20, 0, 0, \"pt\")) # Adds space\n  ) \n\n# Add team logos to ridge plot\nridge_plot + \n  geom_image(data = logos, aes(x = -12, y = team, image = logo), size = 0.07, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  geom_image(data = logos, aes(x = player_xcoord, y = team, image = player), size = 0.1, inherit.aes = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the fantasy points per game for players on each fantasy team. The visualization captures the distribution and density of fantasy points, highlighting the variance in player performance across different teams. It lets viewers easily compare the scoring potential and depth of talent on each fantasy team, allowing the ridge line plot to shine. A head shot of the best player on each fantasy team is added for additional context about each team. The ridges are ordered from lowest fantasy team on the top and highest fantasy scoring team on the bottom of the plot. A colorblind-friendly fill is used for average team age as well using the viridis package.\nSome key takeaways from this ridge line plot are:\n\nThe Bikini Bottom team has the highest concentration of top-end talent, with a wide and tall ridge indicating a roster filled with high-scoring players.\nThe Malibu team also has a strong presence of very good players, as evidenced by their ridge’s width and height.\nMost players in the league fall within the 20 to 30 fantasy points per game range, as seen by the majority of the density being concentrated in this area across all teams.\nTeams with more high-scoring players tend to have older rosters, as indicated by the darker ridge fills for teams like Bikini Bottom and Malibu.\n\nBy presenting the data in this way, the ridge line plot allows for a quick and easy comparison of the fantasy scoring distribution and roster composition across all teams in the league. It provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each team, as well as the overall trends in player performance and age distribution within the league.\n\n\nPlot 3: Sunburst plot\n\n\nCode\n# Importing new libraries\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# Defining sunburst function\nas.sunburstDF &lt;- function(DF, value_column = NULL, add_root = FALSE){\n  require(data.table)\n  \n  if(is.data.table(DF)){\n    DT &lt;- copy(DF)\n  } else {\n    DT &lt;- data.table(DF, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n  }\n  \n  if(add_root){\n    DT[, root := \"Total\"]\n  }\n  \n  colNamesDT &lt;- names(DT)\n  hierarchy_columns &lt;- setdiff(colNamesDT, value_column)\n  DT[, (hierarchy_columns) := lapply(.SD, as.factor), .SDcols = hierarchy_columns]\n  \n  if(is.null(value_column)){\n    if(add_root){\n      setcolorder(DT, c(\"root\", names(DF)))\n    }\n  } else {\n    setnames(DT, value_column, \"values\", skip_absent=TRUE)\n    if(add_root){\n      setcolorder(DT, c(\"root\", setdiff(names(DF), value_column), \"values\"))\n    } else {\n      setcolorder(DT, c(setdiff(names(DF), value_column), \"values\"))\n    }\n  }\n  \n  hierarchyList &lt;- list()\n  for(i in seq_along(hierarchy_columns)){\n    current_columns &lt;- colNamesDT[1:i]\n    if(is.null(value_column)){\n      currentDT &lt;- unique(DT[, ..current_columns][, values := .N, by = current_columns], by = current_columns)\n    } else {\n      currentDT &lt;- DT[, lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = TRUE), by=current_columns, .SDcols = \"values\"]\n    }\n    setnames(currentDT, length(current_columns), \"labels\")\n    hierarchyList[[i]] &lt;- currentDT\n  }\n  \n  hierarchyDT &lt;- rbindlist(hierarchyList, use.names = TRUE, fill = TRUE)\n  \n  parent_columns &lt;- setdiff(names(hierarchyDT), c(\"labels\", \"values\"))\n  hierarchyDT[, parents := apply(.SD, 1, function(x){ifelse(all(is.na(x)), NA_character_, paste(x[!is.na(x)], collapse = \" - \"))}), .SDcols = parent_columns]\n  hierarchyDT[, ids := apply(.SD, 1, function(x){paste(x[!is.na(x)], collapse = \" - \")}), .SDcols = c(\"parents\", \"labels\")]\n  hierarchyDT[, c(parent_columns) := NULL]\n  \n  return(hierarchyDT)\n}\n\n\nNote: the code for creating the sunburst function was adopted from https://rpubs.com/DragonflyStats/Sunburst-Plots-With-Plotly\n\n\nCode\n# Summarize total fantasy points by fantasy team\nteam_summary &lt;- rostered %&gt;%\n  group_by(fantasy_team) %&gt;%\n  summarize(fantasy_points = sum(f_pts, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Convert the summary to the format required for a sunburst plot\nsunburst_data_teams_only &lt;- as.sunburstDF(team_summary, value_column = \"fantasy_points\", add_root = TRUE)\n\n# Create the sunburst plot for fantasy teams\nplot_ly(data = sunburst_data_teams_only,\n        ids = ~ids, \n        labels = ~labels, \n        parents = ~parents,\n        values = ~values,\n        type = 'sunburst',\n        branchvalues = 'total',\n        textinfo = 'label+values',\n        hoverinfo = 'label+percent parent+percent root',\n        insidetextorientation = 'radial'\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = \"Fantasy Scoring Distribution by Team\",\n         margin = list(t = 40, b = 10),\n         sunburstcolorway = c(\"#89AEAA\", \"#020818\", \"#F8DDA2\", \"#9F9F9F\", \"#102450\",\n                              \"#99C783\", \"#D93633\", \"#33ABC5\", \"#A1C7E3\", \"#008A79\",\n                              \"#F9CE84\", \"#8F0B19\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot breaks down the total fantasy scoring across the entire season by team.

This is the perfect opportunity to utilize a sunburst plot, since it effectively illustrates hierarchical relationships and proportions in a visually compact and intuitive manner. The sunburst plot’s outer ring shows age group contributions to total fantasy points for each team, highlighting the impact of age diversity on each fantasy roster. It distinguishes between teams relying on youth versus experience, efficiently mapping the league’s age and scoring dynamics in a single, clear visual. Text is easily integrated using plotly to reveal the percentage of total fantasy points in each section of the plot. The visualization also uses a custom color scheme to distinguish between teams and age groups.\nKey insights from the sunburst plot include:\n\nThe Bikini Bottom Ballers have the largest overall contribution to the league’s total fantasy points, with a significant portion coming from the “Over 30” age group.\nTeams like Slytherin and Las Vegas have a larger proportion of their fantasy points contributed by the “Under 25” age group, indicating a focus on younger talent.\nThe Cream City Crusaders have a significant portion of their fantasy points coming from the “25-29” age group, suggesting a strong core of players in their prime playing years.\n\nThe sunburst plot offers a comprehensive overview of the league’s fantasy scoring landscape, broken down by team and age group, allowing for quick identification of each team’s age composition."

    "text": "Takeaways\nThe exploration of the A.S.S. League’s dynamics through these visualizations reveals some interesting insights into the dynamic between player age and fantasy performance, shedding light on strategic roster constructions across the league. Teams that have older players tend to be the higher fantasy scoring teams, while lower scoring teams are filled with young players who fantasy managers hope will continue to develop and increase their fantasy output. Notably, the Bikini Bottom Ballers’ dominance this season, powered by some elite assets, underscores the potential short-term merits (winning a championship) of investing in win-now talent. However, the Santa Barbara Swell’s forward-looking approach, amassing an impressive stack of first-round picks and building around a once-in-a-lifetime prospect in Victor Wembanyama, signals a promising focus towards long-term dominance. This strategy contrast underlines the league’s evolving nature, where teams aim for championships in distinct time frames. As we head into the fantasy playoffs, the unfolding narratives in the league will certainly add another thrilling chapter to the A.S.S. League’s storied history, with every team vying not just for this season’s glory but for a lasting legacy."

    "title": "A Geospatial Analysis of Houston’s Blackout Sensitivity",
    "section": "Data and Methodology",
    "text": "Data and Methodology\nThe analysis hinges on three key data sources: night light data (NASA 2023), OpenStreetMap data detailing roads and buildings (OpenStreetMaps 2023), and American Community Survey (ACS) socio-economic data. OpenStreetMap and the Landsat data from NASA are regularly-updated databases that are available to the public. I employed R, utilizing libraries such as stars, sf, and terra, to manipulate and analyze these datasets. The methodology involved a step-by-step approach, beginning with the aggregation of night light intensity data to assess blackout areas. I then integrated this with road and building data to estimate the number of homes affected and concluded with an examination of socio-economic factors, offering insights into the recovery dynamics of different communities.\nResearch Question: How did economic status influence the susceptibility and resilience of communities in Houston in the 2021 winter blackouts?\nLet’s get to coding.\nStarting off by loading in the necessary libraries.\n\n# import libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(abind)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(spDataLarge)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(here)\n\n# clear environment for sanity\nrm(list = ls())\n\nNext, importing data. The first set of data is the night light data, made up of tiles, or images, that capture the light intensity emanating from the surface of the planet during nighttime. The data is stored as rasters, and the stars package is used for raster handling.\n\n# read in night lights tiles\nfeb7_h08v05 &lt;- read_stars(here::here(\"blog\", \"2023-12-2-geo-proj\", \"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\"))\nfeb7_h0806 &lt;- read_stars(here::here(\"blog\", \"2023-12-2-geo-proj\", \"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \"VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\"))\nfeb16_h0805 &lt;- read_stars(here::here(\"blog\", \"2023-12-2-geo-proj\", \"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\"))\nfeb16_h0806 &lt;- read_stars(here::here(\"blog\", \"2023-12-2-geo-proj\", \"data\", \"VNP46A1\", \"VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\"))\n\nNext, we want to combine the tiles that have the same date and create two objects. We can utilize the st_mosaic() function to combine the tiles.\n\n# combine tiles for each date to create 2 objects\nfeb7 &lt;- st_mosaic(feb7_h08v05, feb7_h0806)\nfeb16 &lt;- st_mosaic(feb16_h0805, feb16_h0806)\n\nGreat. The next step involves creating a blackout mask to identify areas in Houston that lost power during the winter storms. This is done by calculating the change in light intensity, reclassifying this light internsity difference raster, and then converting the raster to a stars object.\nNow, we want to convert the blackout stars to a vector format and fix any invalid geometries using st_make_valid(). Let’s visualize the blackout in vector format to check where we are at.\n\n# calculate the change in lights intensity from Feb 7 to Feb 16\ndiff &lt;- feb7 - feb16\n\n# reclassify difference raster so it is maleable\ndiff &lt;- rast(diff)\nrmask &lt;- diff\n\n# reclassify difference raster assuming a 200 nW shift was due to the blackout\nrmask[rmask &lt;= 200] = NA\n\n# convert back to a stars object \nblackout_stars &lt;- st_as_stars(rmask)\n\n# convert blackout to vector format and fix invalid geometries, set CRS\nblackout_sf_valid_trans &lt;- st_as_sf(blackout_stars, as_points = FALSE) %&gt;% \n  st_make_valid() %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = 3083)\n\nThe next piece of analysis involves defining the Houston metropolitan area and cropping the blackout mask to this area of interest. It is imperative that the coordinate reference systems align of these two spatial objects!\n\n# define Houston metropolitan coordinates\nhouston_coords &lt;- matrix(c(-96.5, 29, -96.5, 30.5, -94.5, 30.5, -94.5, 29, -96.5, 29), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# create Houston polygon outline\nhouston_poly &lt;- st_polygon(list(houston_coords))\n\n# convert to sf and initially assign CRS EPSG:4326\nhouston &lt;- st_sfc(houston_poly, crs = st_crs(\"EPSG:4326\"))\n\n# transform the Houston polygon to EPSG:3083 \nhouston &lt;- st_transform(houston, crs = \"EPSG:3083\")\n\n# crop the blackout to the Houston metropolitan region\ncropped_blackout_proj &lt;- st_intersection(blackout_sf_valid_trans, houston) \n \n# assign EPSG:3083 CRS to assure consistent CRS\ncropped_blackout_proj &lt;- st_transform(cropped_blackout_proj, crs = \"EPSG:3083\")\n\nplot(cropped_blackout_proj, \n     colorbar = FALSE,\n     main = \"Locations of Significant Light Intensity Change in Houston\")\n\n\n\n\nThis is a visual of the Houston metropolitan area light intensity from before and after the storm. The census tracts that lie in the places where the black dots show up are areas that have been impacted by the blackout.\nNext, we will refine the blackout analysis by excluding areas near highways. This helps in ensuring that the blackout mask we created earlier accurately reflects residential or non-highway areas that lost power, rather than areas simply experiencing less traffic during the storms.\n\n# define SQL query\nquery &lt;- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\n\n# load highway data\nhighways &lt;- st_read(\"data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\", query = query, quiet = TRUE)\n\n# reproject highway to EPSG:3083\nhighway_proj &lt;- st_transform(highways, crs = 3083)\n\n# identify areas within 200m of all highways, dissolve buffer, and convert to sf \nbuffer &lt;- highway_proj %&gt;% \n  st_buffer(200) %&gt;% \n  st_union() %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf()\n\n# exclude areas close to highways from blackout\nblackout &lt;- st_difference(cropped_blackout_proj, buffer)\n\n\nFinding Impacted Homes\nNext, we will look to find the number of homes that have been impacted by the blackouts. A buildings dataset will be loaded in and filtered for residential buildings. Then, we will filter for the homes that are in the blackout area and display this value.\n\n# define SQL query\nquery_buildings &lt;- \"\nSELECT * \nFROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1\nWHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)\nOR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\n\"\n\n# load buildings dataset using st_read and apply the query, reproject CRS\nbuildings_proj &lt;- st_read(\"data/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\", query = query_buildings, quiet = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n# filter for homes within blackout areas by filtering\nimpacted_homes &lt;- buildings_proj[blackout, , op = st_intersects]\n\n# count the number of impacted homes\nnum_impacted_homes &lt;- nrow(impacted_homes)\n\n# show the number of impacted homes\nprint(paste(\"Number of impacted homes:\", num_impacted_homes))\n\n[1] \"Number of impacted homes: 157411\"\n\n\nAs the results show, a grand total of 157,411 residential buildings were impacted by the blackouts. This total quantifies the extreme impact of the storms and highlights how many individuals and families faced the consequences of prolonged blackouts.\n\n\nInvestigating Socioeconomic Factors\nUp next, we want to consider potential disproportionate socioeconomic outcomes, particularly the average income per household in each census tract in the Houston metropolitan area. We will read in a new dataset and pull the income layer from it, and filter for homes in the blackout region using a spatial join of the census tract data and buildings data with the st_join() function.\n\n# geodatabase file path\ngdp_path &lt;- 'blog/2023-12-2-geo-proj/data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb'\n\n# load the geometries from the ACS data\nacs_geom_raw &lt;- st_read(here::here(gdp_path), layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\", quiet = TRUE)\n\n# transform CRS to EPSG:3083\nacs_geom &lt;- st_transform(acs_geom_raw, crs = 3083)\n\n# load the ACS income data\nacs_income &lt;- st_read(here::here(gdp_path), layer = \"X19_INCOME\", quiet = TRUE)\n\n# select the median income column\nacs_income_selected &lt;- acs_income[, c(\"GEOID\", \"B19013e1\")]\n\n# trim the GEOID in acs_income_selected to keep the last 11 characters\nacs_income_selected$GEOID &lt;- substr(acs_income_selected$GEOID, nchar(acs_income_selected$GEOID) - 10, nchar(acs_income_selected$GEOID))\n\n# ensure that GEOID columns are of the same data type\n# convert GEOID to character if they are not\nacs_income_selected$GEOID &lt;- as.character(acs_income_selected$GEOID)\nacs_geom$GEOID &lt;- as.character(acs_geom$GEOID)\n\n# join the datasets\nacs_data &lt;- merge(acs_geom, acs_income_selected, by = \"GEOID\")\n\n# merge census tract information to each impacted building\nimpacted_homes_with_tract &lt;- st_join(impacted_homes, acs_data, join = st_intersects)\n\n# aggregate to find unique census tracts that have had blackouts\ntracts_with_blackouts &lt;- unique(impacted_homes_with_tract$GEOID)\n\n# create a subset of acs_data with only tracts that experienced blackouts\nacs_data_blackouts &lt;- acs_data[acs_data$GEOID %in% tracts_with_blackouts, ]"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe results show that the median income of a census tract did not influence how likely they were to have experienced a blackout. This can be seen in the map, but the box plot reveals it in a clearer picture. While it may seem that poorer tracts would be less likely to be influenced by the blackout and that it would take longer for their power to be fully rejuvenated, it is important to consider that there are many factors to consider in this situation. For example, it is possible that the distribution of power infrastructure and its resilience to extreme weather events played a more significant role in the occurrence of blackouts than socioeconomic factors. Areas with older or less maintained power grids, regardless of the median income of the residents, might have been more susceptible to failures. Additionally, the physical geography of the region, such as elevation or proximity to water bodies, could have influenced the impact of the winter storms on power availability. It’s also worth considering the location of essential services and emergency response priorities, which might lead to quicker restoration in certain areas irrespective of their economic status. These complexities highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach in understanding and addressing the challenges posed by such natural disasters.\nHowever, when considering areas that extended outside of the Houston and looking at all areas of Texas impacted by the blackouts, a Rockefeller foundation study revealed that areas with a high share of minority population were more than four times as likely to suffer a blackout than predominantly white areas. (Hsu 2021) The findings of the Rockefeller Foundation’s study are a call for action. They underscore the urgency for more equitable infrastructure planning and disaster response strategies that recognize and these historical imbalances. As we move forward, it is imperative that resilience and emergency preparedness are seen through the lens of equity, ensuring that all communities, no matter their racial or ethnic makeup, are fortified with the means to withstand the challenges of such catastrophic events."

    "text": "About\n\nPurpose\nThis notebook is designed to perform a comprehensive environmental analysis using two distinct approaches: Air Quality Index (AQI) trend analysis for Santa Barbara County from 2017-2018 and remote sensing data visualization of the 2017 Thomas Fire in California. The primary objectives include demonstrating data manipulation and visualization techniques, time-series analysis for AQI, and the application of true and false color imagery in assessing wildfire impacts. Furthermore, the two parts of the analysis are complementary as the AQI trend analysis allows for the temporal scope of the fire, and the remote sensing segment reveals the spatial scope of the event.\n\n\nHighlights of Analysis\n\nAQI Trend Analysis (2017-2018): Retrieval and preparation of AQI data from the EPA, focusing on data cleaning, concatenation, and column modification. Implementation of a 5-day rolling average for AQI to smooth daily variations and a detailed visualization of these trends over time.\nRemote Sensing Data Visualization: Utilization of Landsat 8 satellite imagery for creating true and false color images of Santa Barbara. Integration of California fire perimeter data to assess the spatial impact of the Thomas Fire, enhancing the understanding of wildfire effects through geospatial analysis.\nData Concatenation and Cleaning: Merging AQI datasets for two consecutive years, followed by data cleaning processes such as modifying column names for consistency and dropping unnecessary columns.\nVisualization Techniques: Development of plots and maps to compare daily AQI values with the 5-day average and to overlay wildfire perimeters on satellite imagery, providing a clear visual representation of both air quality trends and the extent of wildfire damage.\n\n\n\nDataset Description\nThe analysis leverages two primary datasets:\n\nAir Quality Index (AQI) Data: Daily AQI measurements by county for 2017 and 2018, sourced from the EPA, providing insights into air quality trends over the two-year period.\nLandsat 8 Satellite Imagery and Fire Perimeter Data: High-resolution imagery capturing various spectral bands, combined with shapefile data of the 2017 California fire perimeters, to visualize and analyze the impact of wildfires. The data is pulled from the Microsoft PLanetary Computer where it has been pre-processed to remove data outside land and improve the spatial resolution.\n\n\nReferences to Datasets\n\nEPA Air Quality Data: “Daily AQI.” EPA, October 16, 2023. https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#AQI.\nNASA EarthData: “Microsoft Planetary Computer.” Planetary Computer.

The AQI data for 2017 and 2018 is fetched from online sources, ensuring access to the most relevant and up-to-date air quality information.\n\n# Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Read in AQI data for the years 2017 and 2018 from online sources\naqi_17 = pd.read_csv(\"https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip\")\naqi_18 = pd.read_csv(\"https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip\")\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nData Cleaning and Preparation\nThe datasets from different years are concatenated for a comprehensive analysis. Column names are cleaned for consistency, and irrelevant columns are removed, streamlining the data for effective analysis. The conversion of the ‘date’ column to a datetime object and setting it as an index is verified to ensure proper time-series analysis.\n\n# Concatenate the two data frames for combined analysis\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\n# Cleaning column names for ease of use\naqi.columns = aqi.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')\n\n# Filtering data for Santa Barbara County\naqi_sb = aqi[aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\n\n# Removing unnecessary columns\nremove = ['state_name', 'county_name', 'state_code', 'county_code']\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.drop(columns=remove)\n\n# Convert 'date' column to datetime object and set as index\naqi_sb['date'] = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb['date'])\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.set_index('date')\n\nTime-Series Analysis\nA 5-day rolling average for AQI is calculated and checked by displaying the first few entries. This step is critical for smoothing out daily fluctuations and observing longer-term trends in air quality.\n\n# Create a 5-day rolling average for AQI\naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = aqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean()\n\n\n\nFinal Output\nThe output visualizes the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Santa Barbara County across two years: 2017 and 2018. The blue line represents the daily AQI values, showing considerable variability with several peaks indicating days of poor air quality. The orange line depicts the 5-day rolling average of AQI, which smooths out the daily fluctuations to reveal the underlying trends more clearly. Notably, there is a significant peak at the start of December 2017, marked by the dashed vertical line, which correlates to a big fire in the area. Overall, the visualization effectively communicates the temporal changes in air quality and the utility of using a rolling average to understand longer-term trends.\n\n# Plotting daily AQI and 5-day average AQI\naqi_sb['aqi'].plot(label='Daily AQI', color='blue')\naqi_sb['five_day_average'].plot(label='5-Day Average AQI', color='orange', linewidth=2)\nplt.axvline(pd.Timestamp('2017-12-01'), color='black', linestyle='--', label='Start of December 2017')\nplt.title('Daily AQI vs. 5-Day Average AQI')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('AQI Value')\nplt.legend()\nplt.savefig('images/aqi_averages.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1728x1152 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nThis visual shows the exterme impact that the Thomas Fire in December 2017 had on air quality index levels in Santa Barbara. The dotted line represents the start of December 2017 with the fire starting just a few days into the month. and the AQI levels proceed to spike significantly as a result. This is seen in both the daily and 5-day rolling average."

    "title": "The AI Paradox in Environmental Research - Balancing Innovation with Ecological Impact",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn this epoch of technological evolution, artificial intelligence stands at the forefront, bringing forth a paradigm shift in all domains, including environmental research. This shift, however, is not without its dichotomies. AI, while being a potent instrument in environmental conservation efforts that can help address the biggest issues in the field, contributes to environmental issues in its own right, primarily through its significant carbon emissions. In addition to high carbon output, AI systems have a high human cost, as the technology is deeply rooted in the exploitation of human capital. Training AI models has been a revolution in the sense that it has essentially broken Moore’s Law, which states that computational capacity doubles roughly every 18 months. An analysis of the OpenAI research lab found that its AI training models had been doubling in capacity every 3.4 months from 2012 to 2018.(OpenAI 2023) This is roughly a 300,000x increase from Moore’s Law over this six year period, a shocking result that speaks to the speed and scale at which AI is being integrated, scaled and refined. However, this incredible increase in the capacity of AI comes with a price that is paid by the environment since the energy outputs from training these models are quite high and leave behind a significant carbon footprint. The aviation industry will be used as a parallel case study to demonstrate the potential transformation the field of AI could undergo. This discussion aims to delve deeper into this paradox of the benefits that AI brings to solving environmental problems while also realizing the negative environmental impact of these systems, exploring AI’s dual role in environmental research and its broader implications. Understanding and addressing AI’s environmental footprint is not just a technological imperative but a moral and ecological one that is only to get more nuanced as AI continues its sweep over modern civilization.\n\n\n\nThe centrality of technology\n\n\n(Communications 2020)\n\n\nParadox of AI in Environmental Research\nAI’s multifaceted nature in environmental research is a blend of promise and peril. It offers groundbreaking capabilities in analyzing and predicting environmental changes, such as climate variations and pollution trends. However, the carbon footprint associated with training sophisticated AI models is substantial, thereby contributing to the very environmental challenges it seeks to mitigate.\nFirst, consider the promise. There are many incredible AI systems being built that aid in the advancement of carbon neutrality. The International Methane Emissions Observatory leverages AI to revolutionize approaches of monitoring and mitigating methane emissions. The platform is an open source, public database that connects methane emissions data with action on science, transparency and policy to inform the best possible data driven decisions.(UNEP 2022) CO2 AI is another powerful industry player that helps corporations measure, track, simulate and optimize their emissions at scale. The company’s AI tools implement deep learning techniques and graph theory to increase the accuracy of emission measurements. (AI 2023) A third example of a company using AI to address the climate crisis is Earth Insights, a collaborative effort between Hewlett Packard and Conservation International, which uses AI to monitor biodiversity loss of tropical forests worldwide with the goal of protecting these ecosystems through science and policy initiatives. (Moussa 2023) These are only three of the many companies and initiatives that are utilizing AI to reduce the effects of the impending climate crisis through a wide array of strategies. Improvements in energy grid efficiency, vehicle carbon output, building and city emissions, industry-related efficiency improvements in design, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, and farming are some other examples of the benefits AI brings to the table.\nIn the swiftly evolving landscape of AI development, a proliferating concern has emerged regarding the environmental impact of these systems. The University of Massachusetts Amherst conducted a pivotal study, focusing on the energy consumption and consequent carbon emissions of training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Their findings are stark, revealing that the carbon footprint of training a single large language model is roughly an astonishing 300,000 kg of CO2 emissions. (Strubell 2019) To put this into a more tangible perspective, consider someone driving a car or flying in an airplane. The average car, for instance, emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. In this context, the emissions from training one of these large language models equates to the yearly emissions of nearly 65 cars. Similarly, if we consider air travel, a single flight from New York to San Francisco generates about 1 ton of CO2 per passenger. Thus, the emissions from training a large language model are roughly equivalent to 300 such flights. These comparisons shed light on the environmental footprint of AI development, underscoring the need for more sustainable practices in this rapidly advancing field. The energy required for these systems will increase as these AI systems get more powerful and robust, so this problem will only become more pressing over time unless there is a significant shift in where AI systems receive their energy from. (Visuals 2015)\n\n\n\nOne metric ton of C02 for scale\n\n\n(Visuals 2015)\n\n\nQuantifying the Carbon Footprint\n\nChallenges in Measurement\nThe endeavor to accurately quantify AI’s carbon footprint is riddled with complexities. The muddied nature of energy consumption in data centers, coupled with the diverse methodologies used in AI operations, makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact environmental impact. Crawford and Joler’s insightful analysis sheds light on these hidden costs, revealing the extensive energy consumption behind AI’s operations. (Crawford 2018) Their work, published by the SHARE Lab SHARE Foundation and the AI Now Institute NYU, offers a profound insight into the often-overlooked environmental consequences of AI development​​. This intricate web of energy use, stretching from the vast data centers to the minutiae of algorithmic calculations, uncovers a distinct reality. The environmental footprint of AI is not merely a byproduct of its computational processes but a deeply embedded aspect of its very existence. As Crawford and Joler illustrate, every facet of AI, from its design to deployment, is intertwined with significant energy demands. (Crawford 2018) This revelation calls for a recalibration in the approach to building AI tools, urging a shift towards more sustainable practices that consider the long-term ecological impacts. To make matters worse, there is a lack of incentives for companies to share data and publicly display their emissions output. The incredible pace at which the AI and computation industry has evolved and globalized has led to a few players holding the majority of the control of this infrastructure and policy adaptation.\n\n\nTools and Methods\nIn the face of these challenges, the field has witnessed the advent of innovative tools aimed at more accurately measuring the energy consumption and emissions of AI processes. A noteworthy contribution is the emissions calculator developed by Alexandre Lacoste and his team. This tool represents a significant step forward in our ability to pragmatically estimate the carbon footprint associated with AI operations. The underlying research in creating this calculator underscores that emissions are intricately linked to several factors: the geographical location of the training server, the characteristics of the energy grid powering it, the duration of the training process, and the specific hardware utilized for the training. (Lacoste, n.d.) This issue transcends mere technological hurdles, veering into the realms of political will and consumer awareness. \nThere is a pressing need for increased transparency in the AI sector. Contrary to a lack of knowledge, companies are quite cognizant of the extent of training conducted on their hardware. They possess detailed insights into the computational demands of various algorithms, akin to the aviation industry’s awareness of the energy efficiency of air travel. In aviation, there are established standards and detailed reports outlining the hardware used in planes, their flight duration, and distance travele. Similarly, in the AI industry, adopting such standardized reporting and transparency could lead to more informed choices and practices from people actually using the AI. It is vital to draw parallels from sectors like aviation to instill a culture of accountability and sustainability in AI development. Just as the aviation industry has evolved with a focus on energy efficiency and transparency, the AI sector too must embrace these values. This shift not only demands technological innovation but also a concerted effort from policymakers, industry leaders, and consumers to foster an environment where sustainable AI development is not just a choice but an expectation.\n\n\n\nImpact and Implications\nAI’s carbon footprint undeniably casts a long shadow over environmental ecosystems, influencing them at both granular and broader scales. This paradoxical situation, where AI’s immediate benefits in environmental research are contrasted against the more protracted environmental impacts of its carbon emissions, forms a complex ethical tableau. Data centers, pivotal to AI operations, are now outpacing the aviation industry in greenhouse gas emissions. (Cho 2023)\nVenturing into renewable energy solutions for AI systems uncovers additional ecological concerns. Consider lithium, a critical component in the creation of rechargeable batteries. The extraction of this element is a water-intensive process; every ton of lithium extraction requires about 500,000 gallons of water.(IER 2020) This level of water consumption has profound environmental repercussions. In Chile, the world’s second-largest lithium producer, the indigenous Copiapó communities find themselves in a struggle with mining companies over vital land and water rights.(Greenfield 2022) These mining activities in regions like Salar de Atacama, Chile are so water-intensive that, according to the Institute for Energy Research, they account for 65% of the area’s water usage.(IER 2020) The resultant water loss inflicts severe damage on the local ecosystems, leading to the depletion of wetlands and water sources. Such environmental degradation has far-reaching effects, endangering native flora and fauna and severely impacting the lives and livelihoods of local populations. This situation presents a nuanced challenge: while strides in AI technology are heralded for their potential to address environmental issues, their underlying infrastructure and energy sources inadvertently contribute to ecological degradation. The pursuit of technological advancement in AI, therefore, necessitates a careful consideration of its environmental trade-offs, urging a thoughtful and sustainable approach to innovation. The ethical implications of using high-carbon-footprint AI in environmental research revolve around a fundamental conflict. This conflict lies in balancing the immediate utility of AI in research endeavors against the long-term environmental costs, raising questions about the ethical responsibilities of researchers and developers.\n\n\nMitigation Practices and Future Directions\n\nSocietal Adaptation\nThe responsibility of steering AI towards greener practices lies significantly with how societies will adapt and unlock the powers of AI in the environmental space. Collective efforts from researchers, developers, and other civilians are essential in pioneering sustainable AI development. Furthermore, understanding the realities and consequences of climate change can allow communities to have better practices when it comes to climate awareness and outcomes by prioritizing less destructive AI systems. These are the most critical avenues in which society can adapt AI in an environmentally-conscious manner:\n\nRaising ecological awareness about AI’s benefits is crucial. Enhanced data collection, through citizen science initiatives, advanced sensors, and remote monitoring, enriches our understanding and application of AI in environmental contexts. This wealth of data aids in crafting more accurate and responsive solutions to ecological challenges. In high-risk areas, spreading knowledge on crisis management becomes imperative. Gathering data through surveys and community engagement can provide invaluable insights into local needs and vulnerabilities.\nDeveloping disaster maps and emergency plans, bolstered by AI analytics, empowers communities to better safeguard themselves during crises. Proactive measures, such as timely alerts via text and email, must seamlessly integrate into our daily routines, ensuring preparedness becomes a norm rather than an exception.\nBeyond immediate responses, AI’s role in enhancing societal systems is significant. Optimizing food distribution and growth, minimizing waste, and ensuring equitable access to resources are areas where AI can make a substantial difference. The public health sector also stands to gain, with AI-driven solutions potentially improving healthcare delivery and outcomes, particularly in environmentally vulnerable communities.\nCrucially, AI can play a transformative role in building resilient infrastructures that are attuned to the demands of a changing climate. Implementing eco-conscious solutions like wetlands, seawalls, and stormwater ponds can significantly bolster defenses in susceptible regions. This requires a communal shift in perspective, embracing and supporting such infrastructures for their long-term benefits.\nIn addition, AI’s capability in detecting and addressing issues in energy grids and water systems marks a leap forward in infrastructure management. Modern systems and buildings, equipped with AI technologies, are more adept at preemptively identifying and rectifying environmental and operational challenges. Therefore, the integration of AI into our societal fabric, from data gathering to infrastructure development, heralds a new era of eco-conscious and efficient environmental management.\n\n\n\n\nUnlocking Nature through AI\n\n\n(BCG 2023)\n\n\nPolicy and Regulation\nEffective policies, legal frameworks, and comprehensive governmental backing are fundamental in steering AI to be more sustainable. These elements can guide the tech industry in adopting environmentally responsible practices, thereby achieving a crucial balance between technological advancement and ecological conservation. To realize this, global cooperation and standardized AI policies, akin to international climate change agreements, are essential. Such policies can harmonize and mitigate the varying environmental impacts of AI technologies across diverse regions. Mandating transparency and reporting standards is another key step. By requiring companies to disclose their energy consumption and carbon emissions related to AI activities, we can draw on the aviation industry’s approach to transparency, underscoring the potential benefits of such practices in the realm of AI.\nTax incentives also play a vital role. Tax credits, grants, and subsidies can motivate companies, researchers, and institutions to invest in AI solutions that address environmental challenges. Moreover, a regulatory framework focused on the energy consumption of data centers and AI operations is necessary. Setting energy efficiency benchmarks and enforcing penalties for non-compliance could significantly expedite addressing AI’s environmental footprint. Public awareness is an equally important facet. Educating the public about AI’s environmental impact can shift consumer demand towards sustainable AI products and services, thus nudging the market towards greener practices. This comprehensive approach, encompassing policy, regulation, incentives, and awareness, is imperative to shape AI’s future in a way that is both technologically innovative and environmentally responsible.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAs we stand at the crossroads of technological advancement and environmental preservation, the role of artificial intelligence in environmental research embodies a profound paradox. AI’s potential to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges is indisputable, yet its substantial carbon footprint and ecological implications present a legitimate counterbalance. This juxtaposition demands a concerted effort from all sectors of society – particularly policymakers, financial institutions, researchers, and the tech community – to forge a path that harmonizes technological innovation with ecological responsibility.\nFor policymakers, the imperative is clear: to enact comprehensive, forward-thinking legislation that not only promotes sustainable AI practices but also holds the industry accountable for its environmental impact. This involves creating regulatory frameworks that encourage green innovation, enforce transparency in energy consumption and emissions, and support the development of environmentally friendly AI applications. Financial institutions have a pivotal role to play. By directing investments towards sustainable AI ventures and research, they can accelerate the shift towards environmentally conscious technologies. This shift not only aligns with global environmental goals but also opens avenues for sustainable economic growth and long-term profitability in the green technology sector. Researchers and the tech community are tasked with the continuous innovation of AI technologies, ensuring they align with environmental objectives. This includes improving the energy efficiency of AI models, exploring alternative, less carbon-intensive computing methods, and advancing AI applications in environmental monitoring, conservation, and sustainable resource management.\nAbove all, the journey towards an eco-friendly AI future is a collective one. It requires a paradigm shift in how we perceive and utilize technology – not as an end in itself but as a means to a greater goal of ecological sustainability. By integrating ethical considerations into AI development and harnessing its power to serve environmental needs, we can ensure that the AI-driven era ahead is not only technologically advanced but also environmentally conscious and sustainable. Let this be a call to action for everyone involved: to balance the scales between the immense potential of AI and the urgent need to protect and preserve our environment.\n\n\n\nWho Shapes AI?\n\n\n(State 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAI, CO2. 2023. “Overview.” https://co2ai.com/.\n\n\nBCG. 2023. “How AI Can Speed Climate Action.” https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-ai-can-speedup-climate-action.\n\n\nCho, Renee. 2023. “AI’s Growing Carbon Footprint.” https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/06/09/ais-growing-carbon-footprint/.\n\n\nCommunications, Nature. 2020. “The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.” https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-019-14108-y/MediaObjects/41467_2019_14108_Fig5_HTML.png.\n\n\nCrawford, Kate et al. 2018. “Anatomy of AI Systems.” https://anatomyof.ai/img/ai-anatomy-publication.pdf.\n\n\nGreenfield, Nicole. 2022. “Lithium Mining Is Leaving Chile’s Indigenous Communities High and Dry (Literally).” https://www.nrdc.org/stories/lithium-mining-leaving-chiles-indigenous-communities-high-and-dry-literally#:~:text=Chile%20is%20the%20second%2Dlargest,transition%20away%20from%20fossil%20fuels.\n\n\nIER. 2020. “The Environmental Impact of Lithium Batteries.” https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/the-environmental-impact-of-lithium-batteries/.\n\n\nLacoste, Alexandre et al. n.d. “Quantifying the Carbon Emissions of Machine Learning.” https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700.\n\n\nMoussa, Raed. 2023. “HP - Earth Insights.” https://raedmoussa.com/hp-earth-insights.\n\n\nOpenAI. 2023. https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute.\n\n\nState, US Department of. 2023.\n\n\nStrubell, Emma. 2019. “Machine Learning Models for Efficient and Robust Natural Language Processing.” https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2805&context=dissertations_2.\n\n\nUNEP. 2022. “How Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Tackle Environmental Challenges.” https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-artificial-intelligence-helping-tackle-environmental-challenges.\n\n\nVisuals, Carbon. 2015. “One Metric Ton of Carbon.” https://www.carbonvisuals.com/projects/tag/carbon."

The units for which the emissions are recorded in the data set are metric tons of CO2 equivalent per capita.\nFirst, let’s compare the average emission by economic freedom quartile from 2000 to 2020.\n\n# create summary table for mean and stdev of methane emissions for each economic freedom quartile\nmethane_emissions_quartile &lt;- methane_emissions %&gt;% \n  group_by(Year, quartile) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_methane = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE),\n            std_methane = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\n# create bar chart of the above summary table\nmethane_emissions_plot_with_error &lt;- ggplot(methane_emissions_quartile, aes(x = Year, y = avg_methane, color = as.factor(quartile))) +\n  geom_smooth(se = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Methane Emissions Over Time by Economic Freedom Quartile\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Avg Methane Emissions (metric tons of CO2 per capita)\",\n       color = \"Economic Freedom Quartile\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# display the plot\nmethane_emissions_plot_with_error\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, so the second quartile of economically free countries has the highest methane emissions by a significant amount across the entire time period. Overall, the emissions levels of all quartiles decreased from 2000 to 2020, a positive sign in the hopes of becoming a carbon-neutral planet.\nNext, let’s perform a linear regression on the economic freedom index and methane emissions to understand the effect of economic freedom on methane emissions.\n\n# run linear regression\nmethane_lm &lt;- lm(Value ~ economic_freedom_summary_index, data = methane_emissions)\n\nsummary(methane_lm)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Value ~ economic_freedom_summary_index, data = methane_emissions)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6361 -1.0029 -0.7013 -0.0672 14.2312 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                Estimate Std.

Not any better - a negative adjusted r-squared value. This is a sign that the model is a poor fit for the data and is less informative than the mean of the dependent variable. It can also be due to overfitting, but this is not the case since we are only using one predictor variable. Maybe there is a combination of variables from the multitude of columns coming from the freedom data set that could be useful and informative in predicting methane emissions. Let’s take a look.\nThe code below finds the 10 variables that have the strongest correlation to methane emissions.\n\n# make sure 'Value' is numeric\nmethane_emissions$Value &lt;- as.numeric(methane_emissions$Value)\n\n# select only numeric columns (excluding 'Value' for now)\nmethane_numeric &lt;- methane_emissions %&gt;% \n  select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-Value)\n\n# calculate correlation of each numeric column with the 'Value' column\nmethane_correlations &lt;- sapply(methane_numeric, function(x) {\n  if(is.numeric(x)) {\n    return(cor(x, methane_emissions$Value, use = \"complete.obs\"))\n  } else {\n    return(NA)\n  }\n})\n\n# convert to a dataframe \nmethane_corr_results &lt;- as.data.frame(methane_correlations)\n\n# sort by the absolute value to find the strongest correlations\nmethane_sorted_correlations &lt;- methane_corr_results %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(\"series\") %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(abs(methane_corr_results)))\n\n# display results\nhead(methane_sorted_correlations, 10)\n\n                                           series methane_correlations\n1                              ie_state_ownership           -0.3134906\n2                                            data            0.3073977\n3                                          data_4           -0.3000107\n4             x3b_standard_deviation_of_inflation           -0.2831654\n5                      x1a_government_consumption           -0.2736432\n6                                          data_5           -0.2680756\n7                          gender_disparity_index           -0.2157412\n8  x1dii_top_marginal_income_and_payroll_tax_rate            0.2132415\n9                           x1_size_of_government           -0.2067589\n10                      x1d_top_marginal_tax_rate            0.2024452\n\n\nThese are the 10 variables that have the strongest correlation with methane emission levels. For context: the data variable represents government consumption, data_4 represents the top marginal income tax rate, and data_5 represents top marginal tax rate. It is essential to consider whether there is a causal relationship between the variables and the relationships with methane emissions must be investigated on a deeper level to get a sense of the true influence.\nLet’s consider the hypothesis that a strong government with stable currency and lower regulatory influence will have higher methane emissions due to the amount of profitability that can be gained through traditional methane production of goods.\n\nmethane_emission_2020_selected &lt;- methane_emissions %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(country_name, x1_size_of_government, x3_sound_money, x5_regulation, Value, quartile) %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\nemissions_lm_govt &lt;- lm(Value ~ x1_size_of_government + x3_sound_money + x5_regulation, data = methane_emission_2020_selected)\n\nsummary(emissions_lm_govt)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Value ~ x1_size_of_government + x3_sound_money + \n    x5_regulation, data = methane_emission_2020_selected)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.7025 -0.9243 -0.5214  0.1214 10.3849 \n\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.

Interpreting the coefficients: a one unit increase in the size of government is associated with a .20041 metric ton decrease in methane emission levels holding all else constant, a one unit increase in sound money is associated with an increase in a .04109 metric ton increase in emission levels holding all else constant, and a one unit increase in regulation leads to a .07798 metric ton increase in emission levels holding all else constant. The adjusted R-squared value is very low, suggesting that the model explains very little of the variability in methane emission levels. The p-value of .274 speaks to the overall statistical insignificance of the model.\nThere is not evidence that the variables in the freedom data set correlate strongly with methane emission outputs. Intuitively, this makes sense because essentially all nations generate some amount of their energy using methane since it is the traditional method of forming energy. Capitalist, socialist and communist countries alike are more likely to produce the amount of energy needed through whatever means necessary. Energy use is a complex subject and there are many more factors that go into methane emission output levels for each country. Unfortunately, the indices and scores in the freedom dataset are not able to capture all of these nuances and it would take a much larger data with a wider range of relevant columns to accurately predict methane emissions.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Consumption\nIncreasing the rate of renewable energy consumption is imperative in the fight against climate change. While it would be logical to assume that private and public ensurers alike would react to the impending climate crisis by increasing demand in renewable energy, this is not really the case. To make matters worse, oil consumption is actually increasing with ambiguous signs of slowing down. (Lawler 2023)\nPlotting renewable energy percentage levels as a histogram can give us a better understanding of the distribution across all countries in 2020.\n\n# filter renewable energy consumption for 2020\nrenewable_consumption_2020 &lt;- renewable_consumption %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020)\n\n# plot renewable energy consumption histogram.\nggplot(renewable_consumption_2020, aes(x = Value)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Renewable Energy Consumption Percentage\",\n       x = \"Percentage of Renewable Energy Consumption (of total energy use)\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\nThe distribution is strongly right-skewed with a long right tail. There is the highest density of values from zero to about 25 percent, with a strong tail for values above 75% as well.\nNow, I want to investigate whether there is a significant difference in renewable energy consumption between the first and fourth economic freedom quartiles. We can utilize a Welch’s two-sample t-test and create new dataframes of each quartile for the analysis.\n\n# subset renewable energy consumption for Q1 of economic freedom \nquartile_1 &lt;- renewable_consumption %&gt;% \n  filter(quartile == 1) %&gt;%\n  select(Value)\n\n# subset renewable energy consumption for Q4 of economic freedom \nquartile_4 &lt;- renewable_consumption %&gt;% \n  filter(quartile == 4) %&gt;%\n  select(Value)\n\n# Perform Welch's t-test\nt_test_result &lt;- t.test(quartile_1$Value, quartile_4$Value)\n\n# View the results\nt_test_result\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  quartile_1$Value and quartile_4$Value\nt = -24.969, df = 1102.2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -36.61378 -31.27871\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 20.18034  54.12658 \n\n\nThis very small p-value indicates a statistically significant difference in renewable energy consumption rates between the first and fourth economic freedom quartiles. The mean of the fourth quartile is significantly higher than the first quartile. It’s important to remember that this result does not imply causation. The differences could be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as natural resources availability, technological advancements, and public awareness about renewable energy in different countries.\nFinally, let’s look at renewable energy consumption rates across each economic freedom quartile from 2000 to 2020.\n\n# group renewable consumption data by year and quartile\nrenewable_consumption_summary &lt;- renewable_consumption %&gt;% \n  filter(Year &lt;= 2020) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Year, quartile) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_consumption = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\n# plot average renewable consumption rate by quartile\nrenewable_consumption_quartile_plot &lt;- ggplot(renewable_consumption_summary, aes(x = Year, y = avg_consumption, color = as.factor(quartile))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Renewable Energy Consumption Rates Across Economic Freedom Quartiles\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Renewable Energy Consumption (%)\",\n       color = \"Economic Freedom Quartile\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n# display plot\nrenewable_consumption_quartile_plot\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that renewable energy consumption rate average of the lowest quartile is the highest among all quartiles, with the 3rd quartile being the second highest by a significant margin from 2000 all the way up until 2020. This is interesting as it reveals that countries with less economic freedom tend to have higher renewable energy consumption rates. It’s possible this is because of government regulation that mandates a certain level of consumption be renewable. However, there are other alternative hypotheses as well. For instance, it could be that since we know countries that have less freedom tend to have lower GDP and overall economic output, that they simply need less energy overall and can therefore rely more on renewable energy consumption, which might be cheaper and more accessible today that the alternative of coal or oil fueled. Additionally, fostering a preference for renewable energy in poorer, less free countries can decrease the reliance on oil and natural gas, leading to energy portfolios that are more resilient to fluctuations and spikes in prices. This dynamic will be investigated later in the omitted variable bias section.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Output\nRenewable energy output is valuable in determining a country’s economic impact since energy that is consumed can be exported to other countries for consumption. Furthermore, certain countries are better set up to capitalize on the economic gains of producing renewable energy due to regional climate conditions. For example, Costa Rica can produced so much renewable energy that it has enough to export it to countries in the Central American Regional Electricity Market. (Council 2022) Having renewable output rates closer to 100 bodes well for a countries long-term resilience and preparedness for increases in oil prices and the impending need for a total shift to renewable energy. These countries with higher rates are “ahead of the curve” but there are lots of variables that may still make energy demands difficult to meet due to variables outside of that country’s control. Let’s investigate how economic freedom and renewable energy output are related. Are countries with less economic freedom more likely to have higher renewable energy outputs since the government has more control over the market and regional demand for energy? Or are more free economies more likely to report higher renewable energy outputs due to more natural market mechanisms?\n\n# run linear regression of economic freedon on renewable energy output\nrenewable_output_lm &lt;- lm(Value ~ economic_freedom_summary_index, data = renewable_output)\n\nsummary(renewable_output_lm)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Value ~ economic_freedom_summary_index, data = renewable_output)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-52.717 -29.203  -8.951  26.743  72.335 \n\nCoefficients:\n                               Estimate Std.

Countries with higher economic freedom scores tend to have lower rates of renewable energy output. However, the adjusted r-squared value of .0218 says that the model descibes very little of the distribution of renewable energy output.\nNow, let’s investigate the renewable energy output across each freedom quartile over time.\n\n# group renewable consumption data by year and quartile\nrenewable_output_summary &lt;- renewable_output %&gt;% \n  filter(Year &lt;= 2015) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Year, quartile) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_output = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\n# plot average renewable consumption rate by quartile\nrenewable_output_quartile_plot &lt;- ggplot(renewable_output_summary, aes(x = Year, y = avg_output, color = as.factor(quartile))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Renewable Energy Output Rates Across Economic Freedom Quartiles\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Renewable Energy Output Rate (%)\",\n       color = \"Economic Freedom Quartile\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# display plot\nrenewable_output_quartile_plot\n\n\n\n\nWe have to filter the years from 2000 to 2015 since the data set does not contain many values for renewable energy output after 2015. The results are similar to the renewable energy consumption plot: the fourth quartile has the highest output rate, followed by the third quartile. Notably, the most free quartile has seen a strong increase in renewable energy output from 2010 to 2015, which bodes well for future outlook of renewable energy in more open countries.\nNext, let’s see confirm the statement that there is a significant difference in renewable energy output across each quartile of economic freedom with the help of an ANOVA test.\n\nrenewable_output$quartile &lt;- factor(renewable_output$quartile)\n\nanova_ro &lt;- aov(Value ~ quartile, data = renewable_output)\n\nsummary(anova_ro)\n\n              Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \nquartile       3   62414   20805   18.79 4.93e-12 ***\nResiduals   2235 2475053    1107                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n1303 observations deleted due to missingness\n\n\nThe p-value of 4.93e-12 shows a significant difference across economic freedom quartiles for renewable energy output. This checks out with the time series graph shown above, especially when considering the stark differences between the fourth versus the first and second quartiles.\n\n\nForest Depletion\nDeforestation is a global issue that exacerbates the climate crisis. Countries that cut down trees at higher rates for timber and clearing land for agriculture come at the expense of the health of ecosystems around the world. Are countries with more freedom cutting down more forests to exploit the profit it has to offer? Or are less free countries that are economically limited, and likely poorer, more likely to do so?\n\n# generate summary table for forest depletion for 2020\nforest_depletion_2020_quartile_summary &lt;- forest_depletion %&gt;% \n  group_by(quartile) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_depletion = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE),\n            std_depletion = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n# plotting above summary table\nggplot(forest_depletion_2020_quartile_summary, aes(x = factor(quartile), y = avg_depletion)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(), fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = avg_depletion - std_depletion, ymax = avg_depletion + std_depletion), \n                width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Forest Depletion Index by Quartile in 2020\",\n       x = \"Economic Freedom Quartile\",\n       y = \"Average Forest Depletion Index\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization provides some strong takeaways. The least economically free quartile has significantly higher rates of deforestation than the other three quartiles, as the mean for the 4th quartile is roughly 3.5 while the next highest quartile index is less than 1. Furthermore, the most economically free quartile has seen almost no deforestation based on the index score that is very close to zero.\nNow let’s look at deforestation indices over time to see if there is a temporal element to the relationship between economicfreedom and deforestation.\n\n# aggregate the forest depletion data by year and quartile\nforest_depletion_time_series &lt;- forest_depletion %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, quartile) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_depletion = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE),\n            std_depletion = sd(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n# plot a line graph \nggplot(forest_depletion_time_series, aes(x = Year, y = avg_depletion, color = as.factor(quartile))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +  # Increase line thickness\n  labs(title = \"Average Forest Depletion Score by Quartile (2000-2020)\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Forest Depletion Score\",\n       color = \"Economic Freedom Quartile\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe average forest depletion in the least economically free countries appears to be significantly higher than the other quartiles. Notably, the most free quartile has almost no forestation, with the second and third follow behind in order.\nLet’s run an ANOVA test to determine the exact statistical significance here, since there are multiple groups that we want to test for. Using an ANOVA test is just a t-test for multiple groups rather than just two, so for instance this process could be done in a similar fashion by comparing the first and fourth quartiles through a t-test\n\nforest_depletion_2020 &lt;- forest_depletion %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020) %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\nanova_fd &lt;- aov(Value ~ quartile, data = forest_depletion_2020)\n\nsummary(anova_fd)\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \nquartile     1  34.33   34.33   14.73 0.000228 ***\nResiduals   91 211.99    2.33                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe p-value of 0.000228 reveals that there is a significant relationship between the economic freedom quartile and forest depletion across quartiles.\n\n\nWater Stress\nWater stress is significantly exacerbated by climate change, leading to more frequent and severe droughts and water shortages. As global temperatures rise, altered precipitation patterns and increased evaporation rates strain water resources, impacting agriculture, ecosystems, and human populations in a degrading manner. The escalating water stress due to climate change also heightens the risk of regional and global conflicts over water resources and poses challenges for existing water management systems. Furthermore, climate change-induced water stress is likely to have massive effects on food security, public health, and economic stability, especially in vulnerable regions already facing the harsh realities of water scarcity. This section of analysis looks into the dynamic between economic freedom and water stress.\nFirst, let’s determine the variables that have the strongest correlation with water stress in the data sets.\n\n# make sure `Value` is numeric\nwater_stress$Value &lt;- as.numeric(water_stress$Value)\n\n# filter for numeric columns\nwater_stress_numeric &lt;- water_stress %&gt;% \n  select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-Value)\n\n# calculate correlation \nwater_stress_correlations &lt;- sapply(water_stress_numeric, function(x) {\n  if(is.numeric(x)) {\n    return(cor(x, water_stress$Value, use = \"complete.obs\"))\n  } else {\n    return(NA)\n  }\n})\n\n# convert to a dataframe for simplicity\nwater_stress_correlation_results &lt;- as.data.frame(water_stress_correlations)\n\n# sort by the absolute value of correlation\nwater_stress_sorted_correlations &lt;- water_stress_correlation_results %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(\"series\") %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(abs(water_stress_correlation_results)))\n\n# display results\nhead(water_stress_sorted_correlations, 10)\n\n                                           series water_stress_correlations\n1                                          data_4                -0.3370701\n2                                          data_5                -0.3331397\n3                          gender_disparity_index                -0.3300405\n4  x1dii_top_marginal_income_and_payroll_tax_rate                 0.2724939\n5                              ie_state_ownership                -0.2573339\n6                       x1d_top_marginal_tax_rate                 0.2517648\n7             x3b_standard_deviation_of_inflation                -0.2345262\n8                                            data                 0.2053606\n9                      x1a_government_consumption                -0.2029093\n10                           x2h_police_and_crime                 0.1872722\n\n\nFor reference, the following ambiguous columns represent the following: data_4 is the top marginal income tax rate value, data_5 is top marginal income and payroll tax rate value, and data is the government consumption value.\nUsing these values, let’s see what happens when we put together a multi-linear regression where the independent variables are strong fiscal and government related variables\n\nwater_stress_lm &lt;- lm(Value ~ data + data_4 + ie_state_ownership, data = water_stress)\n\nsummary(water_stress_lm)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Value ~ data + data_4 + ie_state_ownership, data = water_stress)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-529.5  -99.8  -16.2   49.0 3378.4 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

A one unit increase in the top marginal income tax leads to a 7.4694 decrease in water stress levels, holding all else constant. Finally, a one unit increase in state ownership leads to a 28.5481 decrease in water stress levels, holding all else constant. The adjusted r-squared value of .1851 tells us that 18.51 percent of the variation in water stress is described by the independent variables used in the model. While the p-value states that the model is statistically significant, more investigation should be done to understand the nuances of the relationship. Water stress is largely a geographical issue as well since some areas are inherently more likely to face water shortages because of their climatic conditions, such as arid regions, or due to geographical features that limit access to sustainable freshwater sources.\n\n\nSimilarity Function\nThe Euclidean distance calculation is a mathematical tool to measure the degree of similarity between countries. It calculates the ‘distance’ between points in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a specific attribute of economic freedom. This method is particularly effective in identifying countries with similar economic profiles, as it provides a straightforward, yet comprehensive, quantitative measure of similarity. By considering multiple economic factors simultaneously, the Euclidean distance offers a nuanced understanding of how closely aligned countries are in terms of their economic policies and practices.\nBelow is a function that determines the Euclidean distance for a certain inputted country. The similarity is determined by the five groups that make up the economic freedom index score: government size, property rights, sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and government regulation.\n\nfind_similar_countries_w_methane &lt;- function(data, target_country, top_n) {\n  # filter the dataset for the year 2020\n  data_2020 &lt;- filter(data, Year == 2020)\n\n  # select relevant columns (5 areas of economic freedom score and score itself)\n  relevant_data &lt;- data_2020 %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(country_name, x1_size_of_government, x2_legal_system_property_rights_with_gender_adjustment, x3_sound_money, x4_freedom_to_trade_internationally, x5_regulation) %&gt;%\n    na.omit()\n\n  # normalize the data\n  normalized_data &lt;- as.data.frame(scale(relevant_data[,-1]))\n  normalized_data$country_name &lt;- relevant_data$country_name\n\n  # calculate Euclidean distances\n  target_country_data &lt;- normalized_data %&gt;% filter(country_name == target_country)\n  distances &lt;- apply(normalized_data[,-ncol(normalized_data)], 1, function(x) {\n    sqrt(sum((x - unlist(target_country_data[,-ncol(target_country_data)]))^2))\n  })\n\n  # combine distances with country names\n  distance_data &lt;- data.frame(country_name = normalized_data$country_name, \n                              eucl_distance = distances)\n\n  # rank countries by distance\n  similar_countries &lt;- distance_data %&gt;% \n    arrange(eucl_distance) %&gt;% \n    filter(country_name != target_country)\n  \n  # filter methane emissions data for 2020\n  emissions_2020 &lt;- methane_emissions %&gt;% \n    filter(Year == 2020)\n\n  # Join the methane emissions data\n  similar_countries_with_emissions &lt;- merge(similar_countries, emissions_2020, by = \"country_name\") %&gt;% \n    dplyr::select(country_name, eucl_distance, Value) %&gt;% \n    arrange(eucl_distance)\n  \n  top_countries &lt;- head(similar_countries_with_emissions, top_n)\n\n  return(top_countries)\n\n}\n\nNow, let’s test the function. Denmark is renowned for having the most climate-friendly policies and overall perspective on environmental issues. This next step of analysis investigates whether a countries Euclidean distance, or similarity, to Denmark using the economic freedom categories can relate to methane emissions output. Simply put: is being more similar to Denmark a good predictor of methane emission level per country?\n\nfind_similar_countries_w_methane(freedom, \"Denmark\", 10)\n\n   country_name eucl_distance     Value\n1       Finland     0.6396362 0.8149538\n2    Luxembourg     0.6477164 0.8815772\n3   Netherlands     0.8955070 0.8715177\n4     Australia     0.9625143 5.1250548\n5        Sweden     0.9671643 0.4628503\n6        Norway     0.9784877 0.8072835\n7         Japan     1.0060645 0.2042065\n8        Canada     1.0504405 2.6348554\n9   New Zealand     1.0715922 6.3341199\n10      Germany     1.0751399 0.5641788\n\n\nThe 10 countries display are the countries that are the most similar to Denmark based on the five economic indices analyzed. Off first glance it seems like many of the countries in this list have friendly environmental policies, so that’s a good sign!\nWe can implement a linear regression to determine the significance between this calculated Euclidean distance and methane emissions. This will determine if there is a significant relationship between the similarity to Denmark and methane emissions.\n\ndenmark_similarity &lt;- find_similar_countries_w_methane(freedom, \"Denmark\", 200)\n\neucl_model &lt;- lm(Value ~ eucl_distance, data = denmark_similarity)\n\nsummary(eucl_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Value ~ eucl_distance, data = denmark_similarity)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6035 -0.9326 -0.6405  0.0336 10.3393 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)    1.90809    0.34503   5.530  1.3e-07 ***\neucl_distance -0.09982    0.08339  -1.197    0.233    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 1.78 on 158 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.008987,  Adjusted R-squared:  0.002715 \nF-statistic: 1.433 on 1 and 158 DF,  p-value: 0.2331\n\n\nThe p-value of .2331 shows that there is not a significant difference in the methane emissions for countries that are have more similar economic freedom profiles. In fact, the eucl_distance coefficient of -.09982 tells us that countries that are one unit of distance further actually have lower methane emissions. The adjusted r-squared value of .002715 says that essentially none of the variance in the model can be described by the Euclidean distance.\nThe results tell us that more research is needed to explore the relationship between economic freedom and methane emissions more comprehensively. Future investigations could involve expanding the dataset to include more years or different economic indicators, potentially revealing unique trends or stronger correlations. Qualitative research, including case studies of specific countries, could provide deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the relationship between economic freedom and water stress."

    "section": "Omitted Variable Bias",
    "text": "Omitted Variable Bias\nAs mentioned earlier in the blog post, the freedom data description mentions that the average GDP in the most economically free countries was much higher than that in the least free countries. Omitted variable bias arises when a relevant variable that significantly influences the dependent variable is not included in the model. In this case, GDP is almost certainly influencing both methane emissions and the economic freedom score. To investigate this potential omitted variable bias, I will read in some more data from the WorldBank to try to better understand how incorporating GDP can aid in the analysis on the relationship between economic freedom and methane emission levels.\nFirst, let’s read in the GDP data from WorldBank. The data set contains total GDP values across the globe from 1960 to 2022. It is important to note that there is a fair amount of missing data, mostly from years before 2000.\n\ngdp &lt;- read.csv(here(\"blog/2023-12-1-stats-proj/data/gdp/gdp_data_clean.csv\"), fill = TRUE)\n\nNext up is manipulating the data so it can be joined with freedom_esg.\n\n# reshape GDP data\ngdp_long &lt;- gdp %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"X\"), names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"GDP\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(sub(\"X\", \"\", Year)))\n\n# make Year column numeric\nfreedom_esg &lt;- freedom_esg %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))\n\n# join the freedom_esg data with gdp_long\ncombined_data &lt;- left_join(gdp_long, freedom_esg, by = c(\"Country.Name\" = \"country_name\", \"Year\")) %&gt;% \n  drop_na()\n\n\ncountries_per_quartile &lt;- combined_data %&gt;% \n  group_by(quartile) %&gt;%\n  summarise(num_countries = n_distinct(Country.Name))\n\n# Print the results\nprint(countries_per_quartile)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  quartile num_countries\n     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1        1            34\n2        2            33\n3        3            26\n4        4            24\n\n\nUnfortunately, some countries were not successful in the join, so we will roll with this new, shorter merged data set. The distribution across each economic freedom quartile is passable with at least 24 countries in each quartile remaining. Furthermore, data is now from 2017 to 2021.\nLet’s look renewable energy consumption versus GDP, as we have discussed this relationship is very likely to be experiencing omitted variable bias when analyzed in the earlier section of the blog post.\n\n# Filter for Renewable Energy Consumption\nrenewable_energy_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  filter(series_name == \"Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)\") %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020)\n\n# Create the scatter plot\nggplot(renewable_energy_data, aes(x = Value, y = GDP, color = as.factor(quartile))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\")) +  # Adjust the colors as needed\n  labs(title = \"Renewable Energy Consumption vs GDP in 2020\",\n       x = \"Renewable Energy Consumption (% of Total Final Energy Consumption)\",\n       y = \"GDP (current US$)\",\n       color = \"Quartile\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try log scaling the data since its a bit wacky and hard to read because of a few outliers and many countries within a similar region of GDP. Log transformation is a powerful technique that is particularly useful for working with skewed distributions and reducing the impact of outliers. By applying a logarithmic scale to the GDP data, extreme values are compressed to a smaller range, making the dataset more manageable and revealing patterns that may be obscured in the original scale. This transformation can also stabilize the variance across the data.\n\n# calculate the means for each quartile for points\nquartile_means &lt;- renewable_energy_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(quartile) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), \n            mean_GDP = mean(GDP, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# create the scatter plot\nggplot(renewable_energy_data, aes(x = Value, y = log(GDP), color = as.factor(quartile))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +  # Original data points\n  geom_point(data = quartile_means, aes(x = mean_Value, y = log(mean_GDP), color = as.factor(quartile)),\n             size = 5, shape = 17) +  # add mean points\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#FFB6C1\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Renewable Energy Consumption vs GDP\",\n       x = \"Renewable Energy Consumption (% of Total Energy Consumption)\",\n       y = \"Log of GDP (current US$)\",\n       color = \"Quartile mean\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows that countries in the least economically free quartile, as classified by their economic freedom scores, typically have lower GDP levels and higher rates of renewable energy consumption compared to other quartiles. This relationship is visually highlighted by the concentration of red points in the bottom right section of the plot, representing the least economically free countries. These points clearly cluster together, indicating a potential trend where these countries, despite having lower GDP, prioritize or utilize renewable energy sources to a greater extent than their more economically free counterparts. To further understand the significance of this relationship, advanced spatial or statistical analysis techniques could be employed. However, the primary purpose of this plot is to provide a visual representation of the relationship between economic freedom, GDP, and renewable energy consumption, serving as a preliminary step in a more in-depth statistical process.\nWhile this blog will not go further into the likelihood of omitted variable bias, there is evidence to suggest that it is influencing the model in a significant way."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis exploration into the relationship between economic freedom and environmental outcomes has yielded a mix of insights and does not provide a definitive answer. The evidence gathered does not conclusively suggest that economic freedom, on a global scale, has a direct and uniform impact on environmental outcomes. This points to the variable nature of these relationships, influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the scope of economic freedom alone. The necessity to look deeper into the potential omitted variable bias, especially in the context of renewable energy use, emerged as a critical aspect of this study. The presence of numerous missing data points in the data sets further complicates the analysis, indicating that a more complete and comprehensive dataset might yield more definitive conclusions. Moving forward, future research could focus on examining national economic situations more closely, identifying region-specific systems and strategies that can effectively address climate outcomes in accordance with their unique economic frameworks. The pursuit of a one-size-fits-all solution to climate change at a global level appears elusive at this stage. The question remains open as to whether free markets or government-led initiatives are more effective in driving environmental solutions.\nIn light of these findings, it becomes clear that addressing the climate crisis requires proactive leadership from governments worldwide. While the role of market mechanisms and economic freedom cannot be discounted, the urgency of the situation calls for governments to lead the way in implementing robust and forward-thinking environmental policies. Furthermore, the responsibility also falls on individuals to overcome the collective action dilemma that is the climate crisis. The challenge lies in placing the well-being of our planet and future generations above immediate personal interests and convenience. The journey towards a more sustainable future is a collective effort, demanding commitment and action from both governmental entities and consumers alike. The results of this investigation underscore the complexity of the climate crisis and the multifaceted approach needed to combat it, blending economic considerations with environmental imperatives for the betterment of humanity."

    "section": "What’s DIC?",
    "text": "What’s DIC?\nDissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is an crucial component of the ocean’s carbon cycle and has significant implications for the health of marine life and climate change as well. Image this: instead of fluid, the ocean is a massive sponge that soaks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Over time, the carbon dioxide dissolves into the water and transforms into different types of dissolved inorganic carbon like carbonic acid and bicarbonate (I won’t cover the chemistry of this transition, but you can learn more about that at [@ScienceDirect]). These types of DIC are kept steady by the pH levels of the ocean (roughly 8.1). Now imagine the sponge, already full, trying to squeeze in more carbon dioxide. This is where things are at at this moment in time: humans are stuffing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, whcih is causing the oceans to absord more carbon dioxide than they are equipped to handle. Increasing the amounts of carbon dioxide in the ocean leads to a malicious process called ocean acidification. The higher carbon dioxide absorption causes a shiftin the delicate balance of DIC in the ocean, causing a decrease in the ocean’s pH level. This is bad news bears for almost anything and everything living in the ocean.\nOcean acidification can have serious consequences on marine organisms that rely on calcification to build their skeletons and shells. Organisms include coral, plankton, crabs, lobsters, and more. And think about this: coral reefs are home to an abundance of life. Often referred to as the rainforests of the sea, coral reefs cover less than one percent of the ocean floor, but support roughly 25 percent of all known marine species. Pretty incredible, and for all of these animals to be put in danger as well makes the impact of ocean acidification nearly incomprehensible. Here’s some science for you: as the ocean gets more acidic, there is a lower supply of carbonate ions which in turns makes it challening for these organisms that rely on calcification to actually build their structures. This reminds me of a situation where the half of the wood on Earth gets infested with something and is unusable, causing the construction industry to go down, then all goods-producing industries, then subsequently every other industry in the global economy to just crash and burn. Coral reefs technically have it even worse than the shellfish since they face the impact of reduced calcification rates AND higher rates of dissolution of their calcium carbonate structures (or backbone). Ocean acidification has extreme consequences, and it is our obligation to limit it as best we can.\nTo make maters worse, rising ocean temperatures and deviations in typical oceanographic patterns can impact the spread and cycle of DIC across the ocean. Warmer waters aren’t able to absorb as much carbon dioxide, so as the ocean rises it is likely going to be the case that less carbon is actually drawn from the atmosphere and absorbed by the ocean. Double whammie!\nHere is what can be done: reduce our carbon emissions and restore coastal ecosystems, and we could be in luck!"

    "text": "Importance of Predicting DIC\n\nUsing ML\nIf we want to tackle the challenges posed by ocean acidification and climate change, we need to be able to predict DIC levels accurately. Here where machine learning comes in to play.\nBy harnessing the power of data and advanced algorithms, we can develop models that help us assess the extent of ocean acidification across different locations and time scales. This is critical for understanding the potential impacts on marine ecosystems and identifying the areas that are most vulnerable. Predicting DIC levels also enables us to establish specific, tailored, and powerful mitigation strategies. By anticipating future changes in DIC and their consequences, we can make informed, (hopefully) accurate decisions about how to allocate resources, prioritize conservation efforts, and adapt our management approaches. That sounds wonderful!\nIn this analysis, my goal was to build a predictive model for DIC using a machine learning approach. I found that XGBoost, a powerful algorithm known for its ability to handle complex relationships and deliver accurate predictions, was the best model based on the data set we were given. I tried a few Random Forest methods, but did not get quite the same results as from XGBoost. By training the model on a dataset of various oceanographic parameters, such as temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations, the goal was to capture and understand the underlying patterns and relationships that influence DIC levels. I also dove deep into the data, exploring the distributions, correlations, and potential multicollinearity among the variables. This let me gain (and now you, the reader) a more holistic understanding of the factors at play.\n\n\nEquity Consequences\nThe impacts of elevated DIC levels on marine ecosystems extend far beyond the realm of environmental conservation. They have profound socio-economic implications that ring through coastal communities and beyond. Many of these communities rely heavily on the health and productivity of marine environments for their livelihoods, and the degradation of these ecosystems can have severe consequences.\nConsider the coral reefs again, which are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification. These underwater hotspots are not only beautiful but also serve as the foundation for thriving ecosystems that support an astonishing diversity of life. Coral reefs attract tourists from around the world, generating significant revenue for local economies through activities such as snorkeling, diving, and beach tourism. However, as DIC levels rise and the ocean becomes more acidic, the delicate balance that sustains these reefs is disrupted. The deterioration of coral reefs can lead to a landslide of ecological effects, culminating in the loss of biodiversity and the decline of the tourism industry that relies on their allure.\nMoreover, the socio-economic consequences of elevated DIC levels extend to the realm of fisheries. Lots of coastal communities rely on fishing as a primary source of both sustenance and income. As ocean acidification alters the chemistry of precious waters, it can have detrimental effects on the growth, survival, and reproduction of many marine species. The destruction of fish populations and altered species distributions can have severe implications for the livelihoods of fishermen and the communities they support. The loss of income and food security can ripple through these societies, exacerbating poverty and social instability. For many coastal communities, the ocean is not merely a resource to be exploited but an integral part of their cultural heritage and identity. The degradation of marine environments can erode the very fabric of these societies, undermining traditional practices, knowledge systems, and social structures that have evolved in harmony with the sea. The loss of cultural heritage and the severing of deep-rooted connections to the ocean can have profound psychological and emotional consequences for these communities."

Key features include latitude and longitude (Lat_Dec, Lon_Dec), which provide spatial context and can capture regional variations in DIC. Nutrient concentrations such as nitrite (NO2uM), nitrate (NO3uM), ammonia (NH3uM), phosphate (PO4uM), and silicate (SiO3uM) are essential for marine primary production and can affect the biological pump that influences DIC levels. Physical parameters like temperature (R_TEMP, Temperature_degC), depth (R_Depth), salinity (R_Sal, Salinity1), and dynamic height (R_DYNHT) play crucial roles in determining the solubility and distribution of DIC in the water column. Dissolved oxygen (R_Oxy_micromol.Kg) and total alkalinity (TA1) are closely linked to the carbonate system and can provide insights into the carbonate chemistry that regulates DIC concentrations.\n\n# Distribution of DIC in data\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.hist(data['DIC'], bins=20)\nplt.xlabel('DIC')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Distribution of DIC')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of DIC is somewhat bimodal, with beaks around 2000 and 2300.\n\n# Correlation heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', square=True)\nplt.title('Correlation Heatmap')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nEven a quick glance reveals that there are some strong levels working in the data across the different features.
